PA Dot will be doing roadworks on Rt 73 from Greenhill Rd to Rt. 29.  
Thousands of cars traveling on Rte 73 go through Skippack Township every day, the occupants completely unaware that history was made along this road. General George Washington, his officers and army of 11,000 soldiers encamped here on two occassions. Today, the township is home to many businesses and families who work, live and play comfortably in the new modern world. With a variety of shopping, restaurants and parks for your recreational pleasure, there’s something for everyone.
