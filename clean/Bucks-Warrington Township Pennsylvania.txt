Q: Where is my water coming from?
A: The Air National Guard (ANG) and EPA have established an area of responsibility bordered in the south by County Line Road, the east by Valley Road, the north by Street Road and the west by Bradford Avenue. Additionally, properties with private wells within 1/4 of a mile of the Little Neshaminy Creek have been approved for testing by the ANG. The ANG and EPA will test any private wells used as a sole source for drinking purposes within that area of responsibility at no cost to you. You may contact Mr. Keith Freihofer, Environmental Restoration Program Manager for the ANG; 3501 Fetchet Avenue- Shepperd Hall, Joint Base Andrews, MD 20762-5157; at (240) 612-8762 to coordinate your private well test.

History
In October of 2014, the Warrington Township Water and Sewer Department (WTWSD) had our public wells sampled for Perfluorinated Compounds (PFCs) as part of the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) third Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR3). At the time, the established Provisional Health Advisory Levels (PHAL) were 200 parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOS and 400 ppt for PFOA. WTWSD promptly shut down public wells 1, 2 and 6 on October 29, 2014 (the same day we received the sampling results). As a continuation of the EPA’s UCMR3 program, we tested our public wells again in May of 2015.

A: The western district of the Township is served entirely by water purchased from NWWA. All public wells within the eastern district of the Township feed into the distribution system of the eastern district. Therefore all public wells in the eastern district (excluding those that have been shut down) contribute to the water that is delivered to all public water customers within the eastern district. Additional water from NWWA is being purchased to supplement the loss of water from the 5 public wells taken offline as a result of contamination.

Traffic Calming Ad Hoc Committee
On May 19, 2016, the EPA released a new combined Health Advisory Level (HAL) for PFOS and PFOA of 70 ppt. WTWSD promptly shut down public wells 3 and 9 that very same day. Although these public wells were considered safe under the PHAL, they at one point exceeded the HAL.
The Communications Advisory Board meeting scheduled for Monday, May 15, 2023 has been postponed and will be rescheduled.
