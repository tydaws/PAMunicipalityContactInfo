As a follow up to the February discussion on the draft large animal ordinance, the Zoning Committee is currently reviewing everyone’s input from the February meeting. The next draft will likely be advertised for review in June, and a hearing with public comment will follow shortly thereafter. We will keep you posted on the progress.
