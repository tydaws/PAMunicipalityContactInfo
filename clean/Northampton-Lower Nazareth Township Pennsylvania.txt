Zoning hearing Board 
Planning & Zoning 
					Gently nestled in rich Eastern Pennsylvania farmland, it was originally part of the “Walking Purchase” of 1737. Purchased from William Penn, this area was originally known as “The Drylands”. This 83 hundred-acre section was once thought to be doomed and was termed, “Barren”. There was very little forest land as the Indians had burned all of the vegetation to drive the game into the open to hunt. This “Barren” appearance of the area gave rise to the popular superstition that no crops could be grown in this region as it was too “dry”. Early residents held a rich religious heritage and named Lower Nazareth Township after the biblical town of Nazareth. In 1740 it was written, “The surface of the township is level; the soil limestone, and well improved by judicious course of crops, and careful culture, and very productive”. In 1807, Lower Nazareth was created. Learn More

To Know 
The Zoning Hearing Board has no legislative power; therefore it can neither make nor modify zoning policy. The Zoning Hearing Board does not have enforcement powers. It is a quasi-judicial body; that is, its powers are to some extent judicial in nature. The board schedules hearings on applications and appeals that come before it, takes evidence, and issues written decisions with findings of fact and conclusions of law. A ZHB must limit its scope of activities to those permitted by the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (MPC) and by the local zoning ordinance.The primary purpose of the Zoning Hearing Board is to help assure fair and equitable application and administration of the zoning ordinance by hearing appeals on the zoning officer’s determinations and by granting relief from the literal enforcement of the ordinance in certain hardship situations. The Board consists of a three-member Board with two alternate members. All members of this Board are appointed by the Board of Supervisors and serve five year terms. They meet on demand, the fourth the Tuesday of each month.

This Commission is a five-member advisory body to the Board of Supervisors. Each member serves a six-year term. The Planning Commission meets on the third Monday of each month. This Commission makes recommendations to the Board of Supervisors on development plans submitted to the Township, suggests modifications where needed, and recommends appropriate actions. The nature of local government requires that the Board of Supervisors dedicate itself to the many issues of day-to-day operations and the details of land use can often be lost in the mountain of important, but time-consuming demands. The Planning Commission, as an independent advisory body, gives the Board of Supervisors the assurance that the important issues of land use and future growth are given the necessary attention.
