A UV/IR patrol (also known as Infrared & Corona inspection) is a similar to a routine visual patrol in terms of patrol speed, but the onboard inspection crew is viewing the transmission line(s) through the infrared and ultraviolet spectrums through specialized cameras. The purpose of a UV/IR patrol is to detect any overheated transmission line components or arcing that isn’t otherwise visible to the naked eye.

7) Public comments
The township just needs to advertise the public meeting as it would any other meeting and put the action item on the agenda. The date does not need to be set when you announce the start of the review period. It would make the most sense to just have the BCPC present the plan at your regularly scheduled Planning Commission meeting via Zoom as we have been doing. The public meeting can occur within the 45-day review period. So if you decide to start the review period at your April meeting, we could meet in May to present the plan to the public.

Within the summary (on pg. 75) of this study area in northern Bucks it was stated that:  “Diabase has no primary porosity, and the depth of fracturing rarely exceeds 100 to 150 feet. Therefore, all ground-water flow is through fractures, and nearly all ground-water storage is in the upper weathered zone. Where the weathered zone is absent, little ground-water storage is available. Many wells drilled into diabase penetrate underlying hydrogeologic units, and these wells may derive some or all of their water from the underlying units.”
3) Review and approval of the March 28, 2023 draft minutes.

It should be noted that the contractor has been authorized to patrol the transmission circuits in their entirety (i.e. “breaker-to-breaker”), so patrols on certain lines may therefore extend into the neighboring regions. The flight crew will provide information on their daily location to Transmission Lines Maintenance, FE East Transmission Operations, and any local airports when in their airspace.

The plan just needs to be posted for public viewing. Usually this is on the municipality’s website with a physical copy also made available at the municipal building. There is no legal requirement to advertise in the local news source or on social media, but these extra steps can certainly be taken.
