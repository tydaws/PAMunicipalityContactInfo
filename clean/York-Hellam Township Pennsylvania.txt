In November, 2004, the Hellam Township Board of Supervisors adopted an (OLDS) On Lot Sewage Disposal System Ordinance, No. 2004-3, as part of compliance requirements to Pennsylvania's Act 537 Plan and to the Township's DEP approved Act 537 Plan. The primary objective of Pa. Act 537 is to protect above and below ground water from contamination through effective maintenance programs for on-lot sewage disposal systems and other sewage disposal systems. Because approximately 70% of Township residents rely on wells and springs as their primary source of drinking water, effective maintenance of on-lot sewage disposal systems is extremely important. This ordinance establishes an OLDS maintenance program which complies with DEP guidelines to ensure Pa. Act 537 compliance. A summary of each property owner's responsibilities under the Ordinance is:
