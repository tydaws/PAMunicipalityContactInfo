 Since that time, there appears to be erroneous information circulating on social media and throughout the Township about defunding the Library.  The Board of Supervisors would like to be clear - there have been no discussions from the Board to defund the Library.  In addition, the Township has not asked the Library to ban any books.

 Instead, at this point, the Township is still in an information-gathering stage.  The Township has been performing due diligence on this issue and has requested that the Library provide its procedures and processes around what media is available to whom, and where it is stored.  The Library has asked for some time to gather that information and will report it back to the Board.
