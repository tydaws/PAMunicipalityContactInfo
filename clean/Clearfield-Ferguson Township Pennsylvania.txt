Ferguson Township Police are available to assist you 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Please review these guidelines about when it’s appropriate to call the police and which number to call to reach an officer:When to Call 9-1-1When you need help or your gut tells you to report something, consider it an emergencyIf you need to report a crime, suspicious vehicles or activity, car crash, an injured person or animal, someone in harm’s way, or something you have witnessed, contact the police immediately. Don’t wait! Give the police the opportunity to apprehend the suspect, gather evidence now, and help when time is critical. Call 9-1-1 any time of the day or night to be connected with a 9-1-1 communications dispatcher. When it’s an emergency, an incident in progress, or something that just happened, 9-1-1 is the number to call to reach a police officer. The Centre County Emergency Communications Center will dispatch an officer to you. Information that needs to get to police as soon as possible will be delayed if you send an email, message the department through Facebook, or if you call the Ferguson Township Police Department administrative offices after hours and leave a message. In an emergency, please do not use email, Facebook, or after-hours phone messages.When in doubt about what qualifies as an emergency, please call 9-1-1. Should you need assistance in the vicinity of the Ferguson Township Municipal Building, the foyer remains open even when the building is closed.
