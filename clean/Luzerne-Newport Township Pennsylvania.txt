A past study had identified 2,500 acres of largely mine-scarred Earth Conservancy land in Newport Township that was most suitable for an ATV park, but this analysis also found additional land would be needed to meet the demand of many riders, Ostrowski has said.
Office hours are: 8:30am to 3:00pm Monday through Friday.
 We hope you enjoy our  website and please visit us often.

Newport Township has ordinances in place that provide for the proper care and control of dogs and cats. During the last few months there have been several complaints regarding animals (both wild and privately owned) roaming unattended. Usually the problems are noise, roaming, or pet waist related. Ordinances 1975-4 (dogs) and 1976-4 (cats) provide guidance to pet owners and are available for inspection at the Township Office, 351 West Kirmar Ave, Wanamie. If you keep a dog(s) or cat(s) at your residence, it would be advisable for you to familiarize yourself with the provisions so that you can maintain your animal properly and avoid any possible violations or associated fines.
Reminder from Jeff Pisanchyn, Code Enforcement Officer Newport Township

Voting Application for Absentee mail-in ballot...more
Much of Newport Township's 19.3 square miles is forest. Many Newport Townships roads traverse sparsely populated areas. This combination lends itself to an enormous problem we see almost every year - Littering and illegal dumping of trash. Civic minded Newport Township citizens like the Community Group, Nanticoke Conservation Club, Greater Nanticoke High School students, and Individual family volunteers have tenaciously performed cleanup programs, but the dumping goes on. Newport Township residents are asked to take on a new commitment to helping stem this problem. Keep a watchful eye, and if littering or dumping is observed, report it to Township Office at 351 W. Kirmar Ave, Wanamie. Include where the trash is located, if the person doing the dumping was identified, any vehicle identification (make, model, color, license plate number.) We intend to schedule extra off-road patrols during the coming months to catch violators in the act, but your assistance would be greatly appreciated, and would go a long way in making the statement, "We will not tolerate littering or illegal dumping in Newport Township".
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE CALL THE MUNICIPAL OFFICE AT 570-735-4735
Questions or comments about the project can be submitted directly to Earth Conservancy at 101 S. Main St., Ashley, PA 18706 or by emailing Hughes at e.hughes@earthconservancy.org.

Residents of the Ridgeview section of Newport Township are reminded that the Ridgeview Property Owner Covenants include an item prohibiting the parking of vehicles on the street. This provision was included primarily as a way to keep Ridgeview's roadway clear and unobstructed, but it is particularly important during the winter months when slippery road conditions occur. Street Department employees will be monitoring adherence in an effort to keep Ridgeview safe and uncluttered. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.
