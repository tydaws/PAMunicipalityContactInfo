Environmental Advisory Committee
The Township Council encourages residents to compost as many leaves as possible on their properties as the primary means of leaf disposal, with the bagged collection program available as an alternative where on-lot composting is not practical.  A “How to” brochure on leaf composting was developed by the Township and is available by clicking the headline above.  Other practical links to composting are also available.

LINK MIDDLETOWN - A key recommendation from the 2020 Middletown Comprehensive Plan was to identify and prioritize new pedestrian connections. Our new initiative, called Link Middletown, connects the entire Township through a Pedestrian Network. It incorporates existing and proposed sidewalks along with Primary and Secondary destinations within the Township to reflect a more comprehensive Pedestrian Network. Click to View the Pedestrian Walkway Network or via the Township's website.
