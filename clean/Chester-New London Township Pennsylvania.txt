The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection approved the “County-wide Act 167 Stormwater Management Plan for Chester County, PA” on July 2, 2013 (as submitted).

All County lands and buildings drain to streams that eventually drain to either the Delaware Bay or Chesapeake Bay. Clean streams are vital to our local communities, natural resources and economy, and will help restore both Bays. Stormwater runoff and its pollution are widespread water quality problems, and have degraded over 55% of the streams within Chester County. Chester County’s Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program has been designed to Improve and protect the water quality of streams, lakes and waterways that receive runoff from County properties by reducing stormwater runoff volume and pollution that is created on, and discharged from, Chester County lands and facilities.

Put trash in its place! Whether at the library, a County office building, a park or a trail, place all trash and waste in trash receptacles. Trash that accumulates in public areas can make it look uncared for and unsafe. It will be carried by stormwater through storm drains and into local creeks and streams.

New London Township is required to obtain a permit under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) in order to operate a storm sewer system. The permit, called a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permit, requires the Township to take certain steps to ensure that stormwater in the Township is properly managed and controlled.  The permit also requires that the Township educate the public about storm water impacts, as well as provide opportunities for public involvement and participation. To read more about the MS4 program, permits and impacts click on the link below:

Avoid Using Salt for De-icing – Salt from de-icing is rapidly becoming a widespread water pollution problem. It dissolves and is carried into streams, storm drains and infiltrates into groundwater.  Consider using non-salt de-icing chemicals. Sand and bird seed are used in place of chemical de-icers. Experiment with what works for you.  If salt is essential, store it AWAY FROM storm drains. Cover it to avoid rain from washing the salt into storm drains and streams.

Some additional things you can do at home and in your neighborhood to help reduce pollution and protect streams and waterways:
  
Management of stormwater is necessary to compensate for the possible impacts of development such as flooding, erosion and sedimentation problems, concentration on flow on adjacent properties, damages to roads, bridges and other infrastructure as well as non-point source pollution washed off from impervious surfaces.
Nothing but rain in the drain! Never pour or throw trash, liquids or any substance into a storm drain. These drains are directly connected to the local stream! And it’s against the law!!
February
Pick up pet waste – pet droppings contain bacteria and parasites as well as nutrients, all of which create water quality problems. Every time it rains, pet waste left to decay can be washed into streams and storm drains. Even when it is not raining, these droppings are unsafe and unhealthy to be left in areas where children play such as parkland and along County trails. Carry disposable bags and pick up your pet’s waste when out on walks or in your yard. Bag it, seal it and deposit it in a trash can or waste receptacle.

Stormwater while running over pavement and parking lots can pick up pollutants before flowing into a nearby river or stream.  The precipitation of Impervious surfaces such as roads, parking lots, and roofs can not soak into the ground through these surfaces.  Impervious surfaces also increase the amount and speed water entering rivers and other water bodies which can increase the severity and frequency of floods, destruction of fish and other water dependent species habitats.  Anything that enters a storm

Stormwater is water that originates during rain events and snow/ice melt. It can soak into the soil or stay on the surface and evaporate.   Stormwater can runoff and end up in nearby streams, rivers, or other water bodies.   This runoff, and the pollution it picks up as it flows, is the main contributor to water quality pollution in Chester County.

Only Rain in the Drain!
Stormwater runs off roof tops, driveways, parking lots, roadways, sidewalks, yards, etc.  Sometimes it flows directly into streams.  In developed areas, this runoff drains to streets, then enters storm drains, flows through stormwater sewer pipes, and eventually discharges to streams.   All particles such as trash, cigarette butts, pet waste, lawn chemicals, de-icing salts and chemicals, vehicle fluid droppings, and everything else that accumulates on the pavements and land surfaces are carried by the stormwater into the streams.

Too much rain, not absorbed into the ground, becomes stormwater runoff. This can cause flooding. Stormwater runoff is also one of the major causes of water pollution in Chester County. Pollutants such as soil and automotive fluid are carried off in the runoff. This polluted runoff is not treated and flows to the nearest stream. Improving the management of stormwater runoff can be accomplished by finding ways to increase the amount of rainwater that can be absorbed into the ground (at home, your business and in your community) and by preventing pollutants from entering the water.
