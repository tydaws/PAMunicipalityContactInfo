Potholes are most prevalent during the spring months when the ground frequently freezes and thaws. When water seeps under the road surface, then freezes as temperatures drop, then thaws as temperatures rise, they cause pockets in the roadway which are driven over by vehicles and broken up into potholes.

Another common road condition that is inconvenient is dust. Some township roads are dirt and gravel which can produce dusty conditions when a vehicle passes on them. In order to lessen the amount and location of dust, the road crew periodically applies calcium chloride to the road surfaces. This treatment absorbs small quantities of moisture from the atmosphere to provide extended dust control.
