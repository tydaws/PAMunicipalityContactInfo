DUKE CENTER — The Otto township supervisors held the obligatory reorganization meeting Monday evening, followed by the initial monthly meeting of the new year.With long-time supervisor Mark Palmer’s decision to step down, and Eric Barton having won both the six- and two-year terms in last year’s election (opting for the longer of the two), at the February 9th meeting, Barton and fellow supervisor Mike Ogilvie will appoint someone for the two-year position. Should they be unable to agree on the appointee, Vacancy Board Delegate Sharon Schwab will cast the deciding vote.Other officials approved for the 2022 calendar year: Jeannine Drummond, Secretary/Treasurer, Pension Administrator, and Open Records Officer; E & M Engineering, engineering firm; Todd Fantaskey, Sewage Enforcement Officer; ERB Inspections, Building Code Enforcement Officer; Gerard Rettger, Emergency Management Coordinator; Eric Barton and Chris Schwab, Police Board; Jodi Flexman and Cynthia Gardner (alternate), Act 32 Voting Delegate; Marilyn Kahle, Rhonda Beckwith and Donna Marshall, Blight Committee; Eric Barton, Roadmaster; and Haines and Co., Auditor for 2019 books.The Park Committee is dissolved, with the supervisors assuming the duties. The Sanitary Authority will need new officers appointed by the supervisors. Employees’ wages and benefits for 2022 were approved unanimously.At the regular meeting, Police Chief Don Nies reported that the county has approved new radios for the Otto Eldred Regional Police Force. These will be purchased and installed in the near future and will benefit all. Chief Nies also reported on his physical rehabilitation, stating he will be fit for regular duty this spring. The other officers are reporting a good (quiet) winter thus far.Scott Bell has been appointed Lead Man on the workforce, and he and the supervisors will be attentive to the consequences of work outside the township.The Blight Committee is concentrating on the two most obvious offenders, multiple vehicles at the Evans residence on Grant Street and the accumulation of “stuff” at the Jesse Miller property on Oil Valley Rd.The recently purchased Armstrong building is being title-searched and should be the legal property of the township before March, at which time the supervisors will commence to reconfigure the floor plan, expand the meeting room, relocate the secretary’s office and welcome the Otto Eldred Police Force to its new office.
