Watts Township, Perry County, PA was created in 1849. It was formed from Buffalo Township. This particular tract of land, known as Watts, was first part of Greenwood, then Buffalo Township. Watts Township was named to honor David Watts, a lawyer, who was the son General Frederick Watts, of Revolutionary War fame.
If you are building a new home, and municipal water/sewer service is not available, the first permit you should obtain is the Sewage Permit. This permit is obtained from the Township Sewage Enforcement Officer (SEO). The requirements for this permit are to have a site that has been tested and found to be acceptable for a on-lot sewage disposal system, have the required planning approvals from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, and have a approved design for the construction of the sewage system. The Township SEO will instruct you on what will be required based upon your situation.

Auditor
Building Permits
The Township Zoning Ordinance is enforced by the Township Zoning Officer. If the applicant’s (a developer or builder) project specifications meet the requirements of the zoning ordinance, as the zoning officer understands them, the application is normally approved. If the zoning provisions are not met, the application is denied. A zoning officer is not vested with a wide range of discretionary power to waive requirements or to tighten the ordinance to protect some perceived public need. The PA Municipalities Planning Code, Section 614 states that “The zoning officer shall administer the zoning ordinance in accordance with its literal terms, and shall not have the power to permit any construction or any use or change of use which does not conform to the zoning ordinance.” If the applicant or a concerned property owner disagrees with the zoning officer’s determination, the remedy exists to appeal the determination to the Township’s Zoning Hearing Board. The Township Zoning Officer oversees and administers and makes determinations on all zoning permits on behalf of Watts Township.
