A complete history of Earl Township is yet to be written. Earl Township was erected in November of 1781 after a group of residents petitioned on August 14, 1781 the court in Reading to separate the “Western District” from the rest of Oley. They reasoned that Oley was too big and needed to be divided. In 1852, a section of Earl Township was ceded to Pike Township thus reducing its’ size.
