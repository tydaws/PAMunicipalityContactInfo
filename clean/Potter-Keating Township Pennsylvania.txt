But residents like Vandermark were less than satisfied, saying while financial assistance may be available to help with the project’s initial expenses there is nothing to mitigate the long-term impact of higher monthly rates that she expects to keep rising.  “People aren’t going to be able to pay it, they’re going to have liens against their homes,” she said.  In addition, Vandermark said after meeting with the DEP, the Citizens’ Committee made specific suggestions to the supervisors on how to bring down the costs of the planned project, suggestions she said have fallen on deaf ears. Six months ago, residents pointed the supervisors in the direction of a gravity fed sewer system being utilized in nearby Hamlin Township. Vandermark said while that system dropped monthly sewer rates there from $55 to $35, the Keating Township Supervisors ultimately dismissed the idea.“We’re pretty well satisfied with what we have in place,” Chapman said. “We’re not seeing the problems you’re seeing.” In the last year, the Citizen’s Committee has collected petitions in opposition to the public sewer project, appealed to Gov. Tom Corbett as well as local elected officials, all to no avail. The project is moving forward with bidding on “Phase Two” set to begin as early as next month.John Stratton, speaking on behalf of the Citizen’s Committee, said the group is rapidly running out of options. “There are only two avenues remaining — the legal system by filing an injunction and the electoral process by voting you out of office,” Stratton said.While acknowledging a legal injunction against the project would be a “divisive and expensive process for both the citizens and the township,” and that two years remain before the next municipal election of any consequence, Stratton urged the supervisors to work with them on reaching a compromise acceptable to both sides.

SMETHPORT — A Keating Township Citizens Committee says it has no other option but to take legal action against the township, or vote elected officials out of office, in working to stop a wildly unpopular $12 million public sewer project there. Residents gave impassioned pleas during Wednesday’s meeting of the township’s board of supervisors, arguing the supervisors have failed to consider the financial impact of the proposed plan on residents of the “economically depressed area.” “Why aren’t we looking into something we can afford,” said Margaret Vandermark of Cyclone. “This is a lot of money out of a lot of people’s pockets.” he Keating Township project involves the construction of two sewage treatment plants serving between 700 and 750 customers. Those customers will be responsible for the expense of hooking into the system — a minimum, initial investment of $500 — as well as monthly sewer rates of $55, up from $36 per month under “Phase One” of the project. The undertaking is part of the state Department of Environmental Protection’s Act 537 Sewage Facilities Program, a controversial mandate that has saddled municipalities across the state with expensive sewage system upgrades in correcting existing sewage disposal deficiencies. On Wednesday, Supervisor Christopher Chapman said the township was equally frustrated with the constraints of the DEP mandate explaining, “We’ve tried to do the best we can with what we have to do.”   Chapman told those gathered there may be money available to help them pay for the parts, labor and equipment necessary to “hook-on” to the new system. Community Development Block Grants (CDBGs), low interest bank loans and Pennsylvania House Finance Agency Renovate and Repair Loans were among the possibilities. “Try everything you can,” Chapman said.
