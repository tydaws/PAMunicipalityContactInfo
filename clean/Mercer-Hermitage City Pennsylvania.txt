When a subdivision plan is approved and recorded, building lots and street right-of-ways are created. Under present day subdivision regulations, the developer of the subdivision is required to complete the construction of the streets at his expense, and then turn them over to the City for perpetual maintenance. Once the construction is completed to City standards, the streets become public streets with the adoption of a Resolution by the Hermitage Board of Commissioners. For more information on paper streets, please reference General Information Regarding Unopened (Paper) Streets (PDF)
