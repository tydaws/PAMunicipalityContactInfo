The Final Rule builds on the program’s successes and implementation efforts so far. In May 2021, Treasury published the Interim Final Rule (IFR) to govern eligible and ineligible uses of funds (as well as other program provisions), sought feedback from the public on these program rules, and began to distribute funds. The IFR went immediately into effect in May, and since then, governments have used SLFRF funds to meet their immediate pandemic response needs and to begin building a strong and equitable recovery.
At Headquarters
The Department of Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development partnered to create the Affordable Housing How-To Guide The purpose of the guide is to assist recipients in implementing their funds for affordable housing. It provides a summary of relevant SLFRF guidance and provides information on ways recipients can combine different sources of federal funds.
