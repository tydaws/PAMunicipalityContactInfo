Also, during the warmer months, plenty of children can be found on the baseball and softball fields where the hometown teams practice and host games. A nearby playground helps to entertain the younger children while their bigger brothers and sisters take to the fields.  There are also playgrounds in the Villages of Hutchinson and Lowber.

For more than 60 years, Crabapple Lake Community Park has served the community in many ways. Anglers can be found casting their lines at the lake throughout the season. Two pavilions and restroom facilities, nestled among the tall oak trees, have hosted plenty of reunions, graduation parties, and family events through the years. And over at the swimming pool, both young and old gather daily to enjoy the lazy, hazy days of summer. The public pool is open, weather permitting, seven days a week during the summer. Season passes are sold to individuals, offering a great price for a summer’s worth of fun. Discounts are given to senior citizens as well.
