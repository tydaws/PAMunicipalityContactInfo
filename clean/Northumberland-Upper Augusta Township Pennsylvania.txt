Leaves only should be raked into windrows along the edge of the Township road.  We would ask residents not to block ditch lines or culverts.  No leaves will be collected along State Highways.  Residents area strongly encouraged to compost the leaves or if a wooded area exists on their property place the leaves there.The Township road crew reserves the right to not collect leaves if they are located outside the reach of the machine, have objects that could damage the machine, or are mulched/packed where they cannot be collected.Leaves will be collected weekly as the weather allows.  The Oaklyn/Hamilton areas will be M/W/F and the Island will be collected on T/R.  This does not mean that the crew will be picking leaves up every day of the week.  They have other duties to perform that will take priority.  If they do not pick your leaves up on the scheduled day, they may be there the next day.
