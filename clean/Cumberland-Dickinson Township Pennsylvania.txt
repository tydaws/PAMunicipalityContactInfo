The Township Supervisors understand that residents are frustrated with the ongoing issues with Waste Management (WM) and missed trash and recycling. Please note that the Township Staff have taken steps with WM  to help improve the situation and that Townships across the County are having the same concerns and issues with their trash companies. The Board and Staff are working hard with our local WM Representatives to hold them accountable.
