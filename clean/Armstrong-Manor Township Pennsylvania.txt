Zoning Hearing Board
If I was pumped out in the last 3 years, will that be when the clock starts or does it begin 1/1/2012? If you provide a manifest proving a pump out in the last 3 years, we will honor that as of the date of your last pump out.
How often must I pump out? Everyone must pump out at least every 3 years. However, upon receiving notification, residents with only 3 people can opt to pump out every 4 years and residents with only 2 or less people can opt to pump out every 5 years.
