FEMA oversees the current National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which requires local governments to meet minimum standards, including updated flood maps and local regulations, public information, offer education to reduce and avoid future flood damage, and a warning and response system. One benefit of exceeding those standards in 2017 is that property owners now may be eligible for a 5 percent reduction in flood insurance premiums.

As many as 200 properties in Upper Makefield Township are at higher risk for flooding, based on historical data. Flood risk maps were updated in 2015. These properties may be required by mortgage lenders to maintain flood insurance. For residents living outside an area of high risk, having flood insurance may still be a wise choice: More than 20 percent of flood claims come from properties outside the high-risk flood area.
