Incorporated in 1781, Fallowfield was the sixth of the original thirteen townships in Washington County.  Originally much larger, the territory of Fallowfield Township was reduced to its present limits by the formation of Somerset Township in 1782, Pike Run Township on April 23, 1792, Carroll Township on September 30, 1834 and Allen Township on June 14, 1858, however it is still one of the largest townships in Washington County. The earliest villages were Ginger Hill, Jonestown and Lover.  Charleroi Borough was not formed until much later. 
Due to the Coronavirus there are attendance restrictions for meetings. Please contact the Township Secretary with questions. Thank you in advance for adhering to these restrictions. We appreciate your patience and understanding.

Farming was the main occupation in 1781 and remained so for the next 150 years.  The land was well suited for raising rye.  Fallowfield Township residents were in the heart of the Whiskey Rebellion in the 1790's and numerous stills were confiscated in 1794 when President George Washington sent troops to enforce the whiskey tax.  By the 1800's, with the development of roads, schools and coal mines the township prospered.  As late as 1870 the township had a tannery, two grist mills, one distillery, two manufacturers of sorghum, five sawmills and one extensive vineyard.

Our Street Address:
The township's fire department was chartered in March 1964 and is headquartered on three acres at Gothheld's Corners, which is the center of the township.  The company started out with one old used pumper.  In 1994, the fire company started an extensive rebuilding project that included erecting an additional double bay garage to house its equipment.  A 1750 GPM Class "A" pumper was purchased in 1996 to replace the department's old one.  The purchase was made possible through a fire tax enacted by the board of supervisors.
Our offices will be closed due to the 4th of July holiday.

News & Updates
There is extensive road construction planned at the Route 481/I-70 interchange beginning in 2014 and work on the Bentleyville interchange getting underway the following year. This will make travel safer and the many medical, educational and business centers of Pittsburgh and Morgantown more easily accessible.

Fallowfield Township is home to 4,351 people (as of 2010). While driving through its 22 square miles, take notice that there are still many farms and rural areas within the Township's borders.  There are historical landmarks that tell the history of the Township and the Alta Vista Industrial Park – conveniently located off the Bentleyville exit of I-70 that consists of 256 acres and is currently home to several world-renowned businesses – is an indication of the future to come.
