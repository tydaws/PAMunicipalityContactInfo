Tree limbsWondering how to get rid of those tree limbs that came down in the last wind storm? Greenville's Public Works department offers tree limb chipper service on the last Monday of the month. Piles are to be no larger than 4’ X 8’ with cut ends to the road.  This service is not intended to be used to chip an entire tree, you will need to contract with a professional company for that.  Call the Town administrative office at 724.588.4193 ext. 402 to be placed on the list.

FAQ'sCode Enforcement Department Frequently Asked QuestionsHow do I contact the code officer? Call the code office at 724-588-4193, ext 401. The code officer is available Monday – Friday 8:00am-4:30pm.What are the two types of building permits in the Town? Town of Greenville Permits - Small projects, like a small storage shed, only require the code officer to inspect your “set backs,” the amount of space you have between new shed and your neighbor’s property line. If you are unsure if you need a permit please call the code office. Pennsylvania Construction Inspection (PCI) Permits - Large projects, like new electrical service, a new garage and any changes to the existing structure, like enlarging a window, do require inspections. The Town has hired Pennsylvania Construction Inspection (PCI) to handle these projects. Just pick up an application in the Town office, fill it out, including a drawing or blueprints of the project, and return it to the Town. Pennsylvania Construction Inspection (PCI) calculates their fee, which is paid when you pick up your building permit. From that point you have direct contact with Pennsylvania Construction Inspection (PCI) to answer any questions and perform your inspections.Fire Department Frequently Asked QuestionsHow do I report a fire hazard or fire code violation? A citizen can report a potential fire hazard, unsafe conditions related to fire safety or a fire code violation inside or outside a private residential or public building to the Department of Fire Prevention 24 hours a day at 724-588-3111. Some common complaints received are non-working or non-existent smoke detectors, combustible trash accumulation, obstructed exit doors and Exit signs, damaged fire hydrants, and electrical hazards.What is the fire insurance rating of the Town of Greenville? The Town of Greenville maintains a Class 4 fire insurance rating (also known as the Public Protection Classification). The rating is determined by a survey conducted by the Insurance Service Office (ISO). ISO surveys the fire protection capabilities of the Town of Greenville every 15 years. The survey includes three critical areas; (1) fire alarm handling which includes the 9-1-1 telephone system and dispatch capabilities, (2) the available water supply for fire protection and (3) the staffing and firefighting equipment maintained by the fire department. ISO assigns a fire protection class number between 1 and 10 to the community. The lower the fire protection class number the better the rating. A low fire protection class number provides a financial benefit to property owners as it is used in figuring fire insurance premiums in that community.Why are the caps and bonnets of fire hydrant painted different colors? Fire hydrants are color coded to indicate the amount of water (gallons per minute) that is available from that fire hydrant. The gallons per minute are determined during flow testing of fire hydrants. Fire hydrant color coding, as recommended by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) Guideline No. 291, is as follows:► Fire hydrant body - Chrome Yellow► Caps and BonnetClass C | Less than 500 GPM | RedClass B | 500-999 GPM | OrangeClass A | 1000-1499 GPM | GreenClass AA | 1500 GPM & Above | Light BlueNOTE: In Greenville, fire hydrants that are painted all black are permanently shut off. Those that are painted silver and red flow less than 300 gpm.Police Department Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat are the requirements for a car seat? Booster seat?

During the summer when school is not in session: Sunday evening – Thursday evening 11:00pm, Friday evening – Saturday evening 12:00am.How do I speak to an officer if the police station is not occupied? Dial 724-662-6110 for all non-emergency calls and advise the county dispatcher that you would like to speak to one of the Greenville Police Officers. The dispatcher will then advise an officer to contact you by phone, or to go to your location to speak to you.  If you have an emergency, dial 911.Who do I contact if I have a civil complaint?

Any criminal complaints please dial 911.Public Works Frequently Asked QuestionsWhy do I have to get a permit to excavate on my property? State law requires that you make the Pa. One Call every time you dig. The town requires that you get an excavation permit when you are digging in the street right of way, street, alley or town property.Does the town issue one call permits? No they are issued by the Pa. One Call System (1 800-242 1776).Waste Water Treatment PlantWhere does waste water come from?Homes--human and household wastes from toilets, sinks, baths, dishwashers, garbage grinders, clothes washers and drains.Industry, Schools, and Business--chemical and other wastes from factories, food-service operations, school activities, hospitals, shopping centers, etc.Storm Water Infiltration and Inflow from Runoff and Groundwater--water that enters the sanitary sewer system during a storm, as well as groundwater that enters through cracks in sewers. The Town of Greenville has one set of sewers for wastewater from homes and businesses (sanitary sewers) and a separate system for storm water runoff (storm sewers) On the average, each person in the U.S. contributes 75-100 gallons of wastewater every day.2. Why am I getting a sewage smell in my home? There is always odor in the sanitary sewer system. It is not allowed to enter your home because of traps in your plumbing system. The trap lays full of water so the odor can not come into your home. In most situations of odor, water has evaporated from a basement drain that is rarely used, allowing fumes from the sewer to come into the home. Usually dumping a bucket of water into all basement drains will correct an odor problem.

The purpose of economic development is to enhance the business environment for a range of business, and their leaders, managers and employees. To do this, economic developers seek ways to strengthen the community’s capacity for business attraction, retention, and expansion, and strengthen the community’s tax base. As we will discuss in this report, all of these goals require the creation of a place that will attract people and give them a high quality of life – business leaders, entrepreneurs, residents, families, visitors, and workers. The purpose of this study is to use data analysis and engagement with community leaders and stakeholders to understand Greenville’s economic and housing status. This information then will inform the development of strategies in support of economic development and continued growth of Greenville’s economy as the Town exits the Act 47 process.Economic Development Strategy

The people in Greenville joined forces and in a 4 day period built a new playground in Riverside Park, with over 1,000 volunteers. The Committee to Promote the Greenville Area recently completed fundraising and installed a new community sign announcing public events in front of the municipal building. The Women's Action Group sponsored the downtown mural.  Three new businesses have opened in the last 6 months in the downtown. Our local fire department maintains a Class 4 ISO fire rating, which affords homeowners and businesses a lower insurance rate. Our biggest event is Heritage Days, the first weekend in July, with thousands of folks coming to Riverside Park for demonstrations and a car show on Main Street. It is also worthy to note that since 1929 Greenville has been the host community for the Greenville Symphony Orchestra with concerts at Thiel's Passavant Center. Greenville Area Community Theatre welcomes all volunteers and features many talented individuals.
