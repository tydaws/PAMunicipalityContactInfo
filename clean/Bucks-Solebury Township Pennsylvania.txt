The Preserve features 134 acres of Pennsylvania forest and meadow in a naturalistic setting for the public to visit and enjoy year-round. This extraordinarily diverse collection of native plants, and the biological communities they support, provides a one-of-a-kind recreational and educational experience, right here in Solebury Township.Visitors can explore the Preserve along 4.5 miles of well-marked trails that wind through picturesque woodlands and meadows, along with two ponds and Pidcock Creek. The Preserve’s educational resources, including nature walks, online and in-person classes, lectures and symposia, are a great way to learn about native plants, their importance to the environment and how everyone can do their part to improve the Earth’s ecosystems, both large and small.Gardeners and landscapers can glean ideas from a display garden of showy native plants and purchase Preserve-grown native plants during the growing season. The Visitor Center offers more resources, including trail maps, a bird observatory, a resource library and the Twinleaf Book & Gift Shop.As a member-supported non-profit organization, the Preserve offers many opportunities for volunteers to participate. The Preserve's mission is to inspire the appreciation and use of native plants by serving as a sanctuary and an educational resource for conservation and stewardship.Bucks County Area Agency on AgingThe Bucks County Area Agency on Aging (AAA) is responsible for the planning and implementation of a variety of services and programs to assist older adults and their families.  Their broad goal is to provide comprehensive services to help adults age 60+ maintain independence in their homes and communities.The agency offers more than twenty programs covering a wide range of needs.  For those who qualify, these services may include in-home personal care and support services; family caregiver support; transportation; home-delivered meals and adult day care.  Additional services include health insurance counseling, adult protective services, legal assistance, health promotion programs and ombudsman services.  Consumers may also call the AAA to inquire about eligibility for the PACE program (pharmaceutical assistance), as well as the Rent and Property Tax Rebate Program.For more information, visit the Bucks County Area Agency on Aging Webpage or call 267-880-5700.Bucks County Audubon Society (Honey Hollow Environmental Educational Center)The Bucks County Audubon Society (BCAS) is a private, non-profit organization founded as a chapter of the National Audubon Society in 1969. Its mission is to foster an awareness, understanding, and above all, a sense of stewardship of the environment.Since its inception, BCAS has been dedicated to conserving land and wildlife, promoting awareness of environmental problems, educating the community about the interdependence of humans and the natural world and furthering the stewardship of our land, air and water resources. BCAS operates the Honey Hollow Environmental Education Center, open to school and community groups for educational programs throughout the year. Because of the early conservation work carried out by local farmers and the Soil Conservation Service, the entire watershed of the Honey Hollow Creek was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1969. It remains the only agriculturally based National Historic Landmark in the United States. The Center also sponsors public programs for all ages, from pre-schoolers through adults, as well as community outreach programs.For more information, visit www.bcas.org or call 215-297-5880.Historic Carversville SocietyIn 1979, the Department of the Interior, recognizing that Carversville was a prime example of a 19th century farming community, designated the village "Historic" thus placing it on the National Register of Historic Places. Because of this designation, it is now under the protection of Federal, State and local laws that protect its historic buildings and its character.Local villagers interested in preserving the history and architecture of Carversville established the Historic Carversville Society in 1971. The objectives of the Society are to collect information on the village, record material of historic interest and identify and preserve historic sites. In an effort to meet these objectives, the Society funds research on historic homes and records oral histories from some of the older residents. A Board of Directors elected by the membership governs the Society.Solebury Township's Historic Ordinance, which governs the historic districts in the Township, has been an invaluable tool for the Society in preserving the village. Under its provisions, the Historic Carversville Society has been successful in protecting many historic homes and in maintaining the unique character of the village.The Society also sponsors social events in the village each year. These events help to promote a sense of community and commitment that make Carversville stand apart from other villages. Among these events are Carversville Clean-up Day, Films in the Field (outdoor movies shown on the wall of the General Store), and Caroling in the Square which occurs just before Christmas. The General Membership meeting in November is the time when the Society reviews the accomplishments of the year and the plans for the next year. The village also hosts an award winning community garden that is cared for by residents and which has become a place where villagers meet to share food and conversation. The largest annual event, Carversville Day, is held in May. It is a unique village fair with food, crafts, games, entertainment, a raffle and auction and the irresistible Carversville Pet Parade.These events are open to everyone and membership in the Society is not required for attendance.For those who wish to join the Society, membership is open to all residents of the village as well as anyone interested in history and preservation. Dues are $30 per year. Membership, donations and proceeds from various events fund all of the Society's activities. If you would like more information about the Historic Carversville Society, please visit www.carversville.org/ or send an email to events@carversville.org.NAACP of Bucks County  NAACP Bucks is one of the 2,200+ chapters of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), America's oldest and largest civil rights organization.

The current project is a new scoreboard.The Association has always been committed to supporting education and granting scholarships to deserving High School seniors each year. All scholarships are made possible through the generous support of many area businesses who sponsor our events.Known as one of the premiere antique and classic car shows in the country, The New Hope Automobile Show is held the second weekend of August each year at the High School. Since 1957, this two day show features a different roster of classic antique cars, trucks, and motorcycles each day.Cycle Bucks County is a one-day charity bicycle ride held in June, designed to raise funds and community awareness for both the New Hope-Solebury Community Association and the Tara L. Riedley Foundation, whose missions are both focused on furthering education and opportunity for all. The ride is open to all levels of cyclists, from beginners to the more advanced riders. Participants choose from four routes ranging in length from 10 to 60 miles, winding through the scenic roadways of Bucks County.If you are looking for a way to serve your community and have a few hours you can give, volunteers are always needed and welcome!For more information contact: New Hope-Solebury Community Association, PO Box 62, New Hope, PA 18938.
