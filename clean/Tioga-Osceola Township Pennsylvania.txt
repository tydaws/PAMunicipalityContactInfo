To qualify for the SEP, consumers must have a household income below 150% of the Federal Poverty Level (approximately $19,000 for an individual and $40,000 for a family of four). Michiganders at this income level will also qualify for an Advance Premium Tax Credit, which may make a Marketplace plan available to them at no- or low-cost. To determine SEP eligibility, log on to the Health Insurance Marketplace to start a new application or modify an existing one. Once the application is completed and a plan is selected, health coverage will begin on the first day of the following month. The last day to select a plan during this period is Nov. 30, 2022. Free local enrollment help is also available at localhelp.healthcare.gov or (877) 999-6442 or (800) 318-2596.
