2021 POWELL ROAD PROJECT
New Sewickley Township is completing the first project as part of its MS4 Permit Pollutant Reduction Plan requirements. The improvements being completed at Green Valley Park will improve the water quality of Brush Creek as well as help control the runoff in the park. The Township is currently installing 16 new storm sewer inlets and approximately 2,100 linear feet of new storm sewer conveyance pipe. This additional infrastructure will capture the stormwater runoff and better convey it to Brush Creek. Additionally, the improvements include construction of a new rain garden, including a Focal Point system. This new rain garden will control the discharge of the stormwater throughout the park by detaining it for a longer period of time. Additionally, the Focal Point is a Biofiltration System that filters the stormwater through its designed media, removing pollutants that are within the stormwater, improving the overall water quality that reaches Brush Creek.

New Sewickley Township’s Planning Commission is currently in the process of doing a 10 year review of the Comprehensive Plan.  A very important part of the process is receiving input from those in our community.

The Township Road Department completed slope stabilization and stormwater sewer improvements on Powell Road between Brush Creek Rd. and Mellon Rd. The improvements included installing multiple catch basins, creating end walls, and adding additional underground pipe crossings to reduce erosive surface flow and limit future road damage due to slides. This project was funded in part by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s Dirt, Gravel, and Low Volume Road Maintenance Program and administered by the Beaver County Conservation District. Thank you to State Senator Elder Vogel Jr. and State Representative Jim Marshall for their continued support of this program.
