Welcome to the City of Connellsville
    Connellsville is decidedly pro-business, spurring an incredible amount of development recently including a new hotel, new retail businesses and restaurants.  Yet we retain a small-town feeling, evidenced by numerous events throughout the city, held throughout the year.

Welcome Visitors!
Mayor Lincoln Welcomes You!

   Great schools, miles of trails and grand river frontage, a farmers' market featuring local vendors, parks with playgrounds, good roads, safe neighborhoods and caring people.  These are just a few of my favorite things about Connellsville.
We take great pride in the City of Connellsville and the quality of life we provide our residents.  With safe neighborhoods, great schools, abundant recreational opportunities, excellent health care facilities combined with the scenic beauty of the Laurel Highlands right in our own back yard.  We are located in the picturesque foothills of the Chestnut Ridge.  Just minutes from historical sites to include Fallingwater, Kentuck Knob, Fort Necessity Battlefield, Laurel Caverns, Friendship Hill, and Ohiopyle State Park.
