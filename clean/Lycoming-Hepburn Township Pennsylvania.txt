There is a two part process for receiving your Zoning and Building permits. First, you must obtain a Zoning permit from the Zoning Officer. This permit is issued once the zoning district regulations have been reviewed and allow for the proposed work, the setback requirements are met, and all local, county, state, federal, and floodplain regulations are met. A fee applies for the zoning permit payable to Hepburn Township.
PLANNING COMMISSION - Appointed 4 year term
Lynn Shade
Dept of Environmental Protection570-327-3636
Once you have completed the zoning permit process, you will be directed to the Building Codes Official. The Building Codes Official will not issue a permit or do any inspections of any work until he receives a copy of the zoning permit issued from the Township Zoning Officer. The Building Codes Official will require plans to be reviewed by him before issuing a permit and will inform you of what inspections will be needed for your project. The Building Codes Official is a third party inspector and payment will be payable to him.
The Hepburn Township Board of Supervisors meet on the 2nd Tuesday of each month at 7:00 p.m.
