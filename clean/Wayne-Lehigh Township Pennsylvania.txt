Lehigh Township was surveyed in 1735 by orders of Thomas Penn. It was proposed that 6,500 acres be set aside for Native Americans, but the land became a settlement of immigrants instead. Before October 1752, when the township was officially created, the area had been called Adjacents to Allen, which probably refers to adjacent Allen Township. Although some residents wanted the name Seimsy after an early Moravian Indian covert named Seim, the county court opted for the name Lehigh Township instead.

The Township's facility is located across the street from the Maintenance Garage.  Residents, at their convenience, are permitted to bring brush, hedge clippings,  and leaves to the facility.  The material is then transported to the First Regional Compost Facility on Weaversville Road and processed into mulch and compost which is then returned to the Township and made available to the residents for their use.
