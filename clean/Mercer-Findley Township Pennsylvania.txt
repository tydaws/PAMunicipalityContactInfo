Recycling Carts are available at the Municipal Building in Clinton - Monday thru Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. If you are moving into a new construction, one Recycling Cart is issued to you for free. Carts are assigned to addresses, so there should already be a cart at existing residences. Additional or replacement carts are also available for $20. Be sure to contact Waste Management to arrange an account to have your trash and recycling collected. Waste Management's telephone number is 800-866-4460.

Unfortunately, there are two 1271 Route 30 addresses - one in Beaver County and our address in Allegheny County. When entering the address into GPS, do not use "Clinton" for the city - use "Findlay Township". That should take you to the correct address for our Municipal Building. We are located very close to the intersection of Route 30 / Clinton Road / Washington Road - there is a traffic light and the Clinton Post Office at that intersection. If you're still lost, give us a call at 724-695-0500, we'll get you to our building.

Old 978 is owned by Allegheny County. Up until last year, Findlay Township performed snow removal under contract with the County. Allegheny County recently restructured their snow contracts and resumed responsibility for all maintenance on Old 978, including snow removal.
