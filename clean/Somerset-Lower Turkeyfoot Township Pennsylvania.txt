At the organization of Somerset county, in 1795, Turkeyfoot township embraced fully one sixth of the entire county. It was the second township within the present territory of the county, having been formed from a portion of Brother’s Valley as a township of Bedford county in the year 1773. Townships organized subsequently reduced the territory of Turkeyfoot, so that in 1848 it embraced only the present townships of Upper and Lower Turkeyfoot, which were organized as separate precincts in that year.

Capt. Andrew Friend, a native of the Potomac valley, in Virginia, a skilled Indian hunter and backwoodsman, moved to the Turkeyfoot region while Indians were still numerous here. He died in Somerset county, aged one hundred and one years. One of Friend’s daughters married a Hyatt, a member of one of the early Turkeyfoot families.
The colony which founded the Jersey Baptist church came from New Jersey to Turkeyfoot about 1774. This colony consisted of fifteen or twenty families, more or less intimately connected by ties of relationship and intermarriage. The early settlers, aside from the New Jersey colony, came mainly from Maryland and Virginia, following what was then a well- defined route of travel, the old Turkeyfoot road. This road came down White’s creek to the Casselman, which it crossed near Harnedsville, crossed the Hog Back where Ursina now is, thence onward across Laurel Hill creek where the old stockade stood, and up the Lick river to Stewart’s crossing, near Connellsville.
There is authentic testimony that several white men were settled at or near Turkeyfoot in 1768. The names of these pioneers were Henry Abrahams, Ezekiel Dewitt, James Spencer, Benjamin Jennings, John Cooper, Ezekiel Hickman, John Enslow, Henry Enslow and Benj. Pursley.
<center><strong>HISTORY OF THE TOWNSHIP</strong></center>Turkeyfoot derived its name from a peculiar natural configuration of the land formed by the junction of three rivers where the town of Confluence now stands. Within the territory of Lower Turkeyfoot the first settlements in Somerset county were made. Here white men dwelt in the hunting-grounds of the savages; here the severest trials of pioneer life were encountered.

John McNair, a revolutionary soldier, was a native of Scotland. After the war he settled near Harnedsville, where he died. Edward Harned married Ann, daughter of John McNair, for his second wife.
Andrew Ream (the name was originally spelled Rihm) is believed to have come to the Turkeyfoot region in 1763. He was born in 1737, and died in 1818. His farm was the land on which the town of Ursina now is. Samuel, the last survivor of the family, died several years ago. The grandfather of Andrew Ream came to Philadelphia with William Penn in 1863, and built fourteen houses in the town.
Other early settlers were William Rush, the Tissue family, the Hannas, Collins, Jennings, Tannehills, Hyatts and Colborns.
