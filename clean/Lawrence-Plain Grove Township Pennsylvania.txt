Plain Grove Township Lawrence County
			
Lawrence County has launched a comprehensive study of the county’s current internet infrastructure with the goal of broadband expansion. All residents are being asked to complete this brief online survey so that officials can better understand residents’ internet needs and challenges. The more residents who take the survey, the more complete the understanding of the county’s strengths and weaknesses.The survey also hosts an internet speed test that will pinpoint the exact speeds of service at your location.Together, the results will provide critical data in creating a roadmap to help secure state and federal funding opportunities. It will also help inform county officials on how best to deploy funds within the county to improve the quality, availability, and adoption of high-speed internet. Click on the link below to go to the website for more information and the Survey.  https://www.linkuplawrence.com
