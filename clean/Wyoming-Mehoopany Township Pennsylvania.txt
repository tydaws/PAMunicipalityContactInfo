Face period is September 16th through November 15th.
The name “Mehoopany” is an Indian word meaning ‘place of beads’.  In 1792 a famous Circuit Rider wrote about crossing the ferry at Mehoopany.  During the 19th Century the village flourished as a lumber center, with logs coming down the creeks from the surrounding mountains.  Later the railroad shipped wood, farm products, and huckleberries to city markets.  The grist mill, the former Kintner Milling Company active from 1842 until 1981,  is one of the oldest structures still standing in Mehoopany.  It is now owned and utilized by the FWM Volunteer Fire Company.
Tax bills are issued to everyone if you DO NOT receive a bill contact the Mehoopany Township Tax Collector immediately. By law you are responsible for the tax whether you have received the bill or not.
