South Hanover Township’s MS4 coverage under the Commonwealth’s General Permit (PAG-13), #133500, is valid from April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2020. South Hanover Township is considered a renewal permittee as the previous permit covered activities from 2003. Annual reporting to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) is required, since the entirety of the township is located within the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The Township will monitor the Stormwater Management Program (SWMP) and update it as necessary, including the Good Housekeeping Operation & Maintenance Program targeting Minimum Control Measure (MCM) #6. As part of the Township’s authorization to discharge runoff from the MS4 to surface waters of the Commonwealth, there are specific requirements that include pollution prevention and good housekeeping for municipal operations to improve water quality.

Portions of these federal regulations are incorporated into Pennsylvania regulations; and within each MCM, Pennsylvania is requiring the implementation of several Best Management Practices (BMPs). Each BMP is associated with Measurable Goals defined by PA DEP to guide reporting and evaluation of the permittee’s SWMP accomplishments. Below are the categories for each of the six MCMs:
