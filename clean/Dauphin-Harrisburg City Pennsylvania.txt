If you need to dispose of construction waste, are cleaning out a house, or have a large amount of yard waste, please consider renting a roll-off container or dumpster from Public Works for that purpose. Alternately you can hire a professional hauler.
Plastic shopping bags:  All Harrisburg-area grocery stores and many of the big-box stores have bins at their front doors to accept your plastic shopping bags and other plastic wrap such as dry-cleaning bags and the wrappers for paper towels and bath tissues. Please save your plastic bags and take them to the store for recycling. They are used to manufacture plastic lumber products.

Cardboard:  If you have more cardboard boxes than can fit easily into your recycling barrel, please break the boxes down and bundle them together with a piece of string. If it is raining on your collection day, please consider storing the cardboard until the next collection time. Please put pizza boxes in the trash.
Yard waste does not include grass; please cut grass often enough to avoid raking so clipping are natural mulch for the lawn.

The Physical Fitness Test is a specific battery of tests that applicants must be able to pass. The standard used in the physical fitness test were derived from law enforcement physical fitness norms that are based on a representative sample of approximately 4000 officers that were stratified (by age and gender) and randomly selected from 40 municipal, state and federal agencies. The physical fitness test measures those job-related physical fitness areas that have been shown to be underlying and predictive factors for officer physical abilities to perform the essential physical tasks and functions of the job. This is a Pass/Fail test.
