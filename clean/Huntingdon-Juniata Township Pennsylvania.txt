Planning Commission
Please contact the Township Secretary no later than the Friday before each monthly meeting if you have a request that will require action by the Board of Supervisors.  Failing to be on the agenda means that necessary resources may not be available to discuss your request. (for example, Attorney, Engineer, Sewage and Code Enforcement) Not being on the meeting agenda will delay action by the Board of Supervisors until the next public meeting (30 days).
