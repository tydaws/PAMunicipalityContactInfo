The supervisors’ secretary read the township’s budget line-for-line, pausing to allow Wagner to answer questions about miscellaneous expenses. And, Wagner spent a significant portion of the meeting giving updates about the township’s various projects, often responding to individual questions about the state of a ditch that was to be dug, a waterline that might need to be fixed or whose family once owned a now-abandoned alleyway.

Wagner told the township residents many of his changes were due to a general lack of safety throughout the township’s assets. 
Because of the price of materials, the estimated cost of the project increased from about $70,000 to $92,100, he said. 
A new local services tax was approved unanimously by the supervisors to replace the township’s current emergency services tax in 2022. Willett explained the tax is applied to people who work within the township, but don’t live there.
As for using the township’s assets for bingo, Wagner said he changed the locks to the building, because many township records are kept in the building. Instead of providing the bingo players new keys as had been done before, Wagner said a township employee would let the players in when games were scheduled, and players could lock the doors after.

“I fixed the door at the water treatment center, because you could essentially knock it open by hitting it with your shoulder,” Wagner said when confronted with questions about the replacement costs. “Public safety is essential. Before, anyone could go up there and mess with the water.”
