Valley Township was formed in 1852 by a decree of the court; it was composed of a considerable slice off the south end of West Caln and a small slice off the south end of West Brandywine. The township has several older communities like Rock Run, Hayti, Coatesville Heights, and Westwood. It is still the home of a couple of farms and the Brandywine River flows through the Rock Run and West wood sections of the township. The Sucker Run, which flows through Westwood, provided water to the steel mill.Learn More...

The Pennsylvania Human Relations Act provides additional protections by prohibiting discrimination on the basis of age (defined as over 40) and against handlers and trainers of assistance animals for people with disabilities. Additionally, many municipalities have enacted local anti-discrimination ordinances that ensure equal access to housing regardless of additional protected classes such as marital status, sexual orientation, gender identity, source of income, and other characteristics.

Valley Township Meeting Schedule
The Fair Housing ActTitle VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, or the Fair Housing Act, protects individuals from discrimination in the rental, sale, and financing of housing and in other housing-related transactions. Under the Fair Housing Act, it is against the law for a housing provider to do any of the following because of a consumer’s race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability:Refuse to rent or sell housingRefuse to negotiate for the rental or sale of housingMake housing unavailable or deny that housing is availableSet different terms, conditions or privileges for the sale or rental of housingAdvertise in a discriminatory wayThreaten, coerce, or intimidate anyone exercising fair housing rightsThe Fair Housing Act is a very broad law prohibiting discrimination in apartments and other rental housing, public and subsidized housing, homes for sale, condominiums, mobile home parks, dormitories, nursing homes, group homes, homeless shelters, and nonprofit housing programs. Mortgage lending, appraisals, homeowners insurance, and zoning and land use are also covered under the Fair Housing Act.  Assessment of Fair HousingAffirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) is a legal requirement that federal agencies and federal grantees, such as the Chester County Department of Community Development (DCD), further the purposes of the Fair Housing Act. In addition to combating discrimination, AFFH requires these entities to overcome patterns of segregation and foster inclusive communities free from barriers that restrict access to opportunity based on protected characteristics as defined by Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and all related statutes. In June 2017, DCD and the Housing Authority of Chester County (HACC), received approval for their joint Assessment of Fair Housing (AFH) from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The AFH Action Plan establishes housing goals and corresponding action items that will guide efforts to affirmatively further fair housing through 2022.Chester County Assessment of Fair Housing, 2018-20222020 Assessment of Fair Housing Progress ReportChester County Language Access PlanFair Housing ResourcesFair Housing for Local Governments Recording Passcode: Lp=?dVF8Fair Housing for Local Governments Slide DeckPresentations: "Familial Status and Equal Access," "Reasonable Accommodations and Modifications," "Land Use and Disparate Access to Wealth," "Fair Housing and Successful Rental Experience," "Fair Housing for Landlords," "Fair Housing for Local Governments" and "Fair Housing: Familial Status, Equal Access and Gender Identity", "Fair Housing Strategies for Case Managers" "Fair Housing Best Practices for Providers"50th Anniversary of the Fair Housing Act (video)HUD Brochure: Fair Housing: Equal Opportunity for AllFair Housing for Consumers Guide Book (en español)Reasonable Accommodations and Modifications Communicating with Persons with Disabilities Familial Status Discrimination Assistance Animals and No Pet PoliciesKnow Your Responsibilities as a Landlord or Property Manager in PennsylvaniaKnow Your Rights as a Renter in Pennsylvania(en español)LGBTQ+ StatusHUD LGBT Equal Access RuleFair Housing Guide for Local GovernmentsThe Housing Equality Center of Pennsylvania maintains a library of additional fair housing information for consumers, members of protected classes, and resources for frequently asked questions.Fair Housing ComplaintsHousing discrimination related to race, color, sex, national origin, religion, familial status, or disability is prohibited by Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Federal Fair Housing Act); the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act adds the additional protected classes of age and ancestry. If you have unlawfully experienced housing discrimination, please contact DCD at [email protected] or one of the resources below: Housing Equality Center of PennsylvaniaTelephone: (866) 540-FAIRU.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (español)Telephone: (800) 669-9777 (or 800-927-9275 for TTYFair Housing Protections for People with DisabilitiesUnder the Fair Housing Act, a disability is defined as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of a person’s major life activities. Housing providers are required to make reasonable accommodations, which are changes in the rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a person with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. A simple example of a reasonable accommodation would be to waive a "no pets" policy for a person with a disability who requires an assistance animal. The Fair Housing Act also requires housing providers to allow tenants to make reasonable modifications, or physical alterations, to their housing unit. Examples of reasonable modifications include installation of a wheelchair ramp or grab bars in the bathroom. Generally modifications are made at the tenant's expense, unless the housing receives HUD funding that requires the provider to bear the cost of reasonable modifications.  According to fair housing law, "reasonable" means that the request: 1) Does not cause an undue financial and administrative burden to the housing provider; 2) Does not cause a basic change in the nature of the housing program available; 3) Will not cause harm or damage to others; and 4) Is technologically possible.
