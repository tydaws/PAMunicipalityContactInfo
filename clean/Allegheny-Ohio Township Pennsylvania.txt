Service Summary
DEP Municipal Stormwater Website
Stormwater runoff is rainfall that flows over the ground surface and is created when rain falls on roads, driveways, parking lots, rooftops and other impervious surfaces. Runoff eventually enters into a storm system and then discharges into a stream or river. Stormwater runoff in Ohio Township discharges into the Ohio River.

Ohio Township was the third township to be formed in Allegheny County in September, 1803. We are located nine (9) miles northwest of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. During the past 200 years, Ohio Township has quietly made the transition from an agricultural area to a mix of suburban residential developments and commercial businesses.

Fire Safety and Ambulance Response
An illicit discharge is defined as any discharge to the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) that is not entirely composed of storm water. This includes, but is not limited to, yard waste, pet waste, litter, debris, paint, motor oil, car wash detergents, and illegal sanitary connections. These non-stormwater discharges enter our local waterways untreated. Procedures to detect and eliminate illicit discharges have been implemented into the Township's Stormwater Management Program. Click here to report an illicit discharge.

FERTILIZE SMART! When using fertilizers and pesticides, follow the label for use and storage methods. Excess fertilizer and pesticides won’t improve grass growth and can run off into the street and enter the storm system. You can also test your soil to save money in the long run by avoiding over-application and determine exactly what a lawn needs to look sharp. Test kits are relatively inexpensive and are available at local hardware stores, garden centers, or any county Penn State Extension office.

DON’T LITTER! Always dispose of trash and other debris in the proper receptacles. Most debris that on roadways eventually discharges into streams and rivers.

As stormwater runoff flows over the ground, it picks up many pollutants such as sediment, fertilizers, pesticides, oil, trash, and debris which also discharge into local waterways. According to the Center for Watershed Protection, stormwater runoff is considered the number one cause of stream impairment in urban areas.

This is done by managing the Township’s Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System, or MS4. The Township’s MS4 is essentially the storm system which is owned and managed by Ohio Township (i.e. township-owned roads and property). This may include anything that carries stormwater such as catch basins, pipes, ditches, and swales.
