Anchored by Funzilla and Big Lots in the Lincoln Highway shopping center, the gym, which had opened 10 years prior, was in bad shape when Zolnowski took the helm in August 2021. The signature red and yellow walls made for gaudy backdrops behind dilapidated fitness equipment. Danielle Pellegrini, Zolnowski’s fitness director, who at the time was a member, described her boss as being the catalyst who “saved the gym.”

This question often comes up. People are concerned that not all of the materials they put in their recycle bin are recycled. Their concern is that some end up in landfills. This leads some to minimize their recycling efforts. According to several major waste management firms in Montgomery County, all of the acceptable recycled materials listed above are being recycled.
Materials contaminated with food or liquid cannot be recycled. Here is what you should do:

Falls Township is required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to adopt an ordinance regulating development within flood hazard areas. FEMA has developed new floodplain maps which reflect changes to the previous maps from May 18, 1999. The new floodplain maps which will go into effect on March 16, 2015 indicate properties located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA). Many, although not all property owners will be required to obtain flood insurance, even if there is no record of a flood on the property. The development standards limit development within flood hazard areas, including accessory structures and material stored outside.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact us all; in our businesses, our communities and our personal lives. Over the past few months, the stay at home order has directly affected the volumes of household waste, recycling and yard waste that families are placing at the curb each week. The amount of materials we are collecting has increased by 30%, which in turn, directly increases the length of time it takes for our drivers and helpers to service your community. We are working to add additional staff to accommodate this increased volume to avoid service delays in the future. We truly appreciate your patience, as we work to ensure the health and safety of our employees and all the residents of Falls Township. If you have any concerns or questions, please feel free contact us at 1-800-869-5566.

The county hopes that this webpage will serve as useful tool.  The county remains open to constructive feedback on the webpage to help enhance the data offerings and to continue to improve its ease of use and applicability.
In simple terms, if the Township fails to enforce this new ordinance, you may be unable to obtain a mortgage to buy or sell property in a flood hazard area. In the event of a flood, you will not have insurance to repair or replace damaged property. The following links will direct you to floodplain information regarding your property and NFIP information.
PECO Related Information 
j.ryan@fallstwp.com 
Adoption of a floodplain ordinance is mandated by the federal government in order for properties within the jurisdiction to obtain federally subsidized flood insurance. If Falls Township fails to enforce the floodplain ordinance, no property within the Township will be eligible to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), including those who already have federally subsidized flood insurance. Properties in flood hazard areas that do not have floodplain insurance may not be eligible for a mortgage.
