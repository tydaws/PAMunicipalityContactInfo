SLF is a serious invasive pest with a healthy appetite for our plants and it can be a significant nuisance, affecting the quality of life and enjoyment of the outdoors. If not contained, spotted lanternfly potentially could drain Pennsylvania's economy of at least $324 million annually, according to a study carried out by economists at Penn State. The spotted lanternfly uses its piercing-sucking mouthpart to feed on sap from over 70 different plant species. It has a strong preference for economically important plants including grapevines, maple trees, black walnut, birch, willow, and other trees. The feeding damage significantly stresses the plants which can lead to decreased health and potentially death.

The area known today as Towamensing Township was originally called "Saint Anthony's Wilderness". The word Towamensing is derived from a Lenape Indian word meaning uninhabited. Today, the township is semi-rural, with small farms interspersed between homes and woodlands. The jewel of our township is Beltzville State Park and Lake, providing residents and visitors with opportunities for year-round recreation including swimming, fishing, hiking, boating, bird-watching, and cross-country skiing.

Food Tainted Items
As SLF feeds, the insect excretes honeydew (a sugary substance) which can attract bees, wasps, and other insects. The honeydew also builds up and promotes the growth for sooty mold (fungi), which can cover the plant, forest understories, patio furniture, cars, and anything else found below SLF feeding.
The Township is located within the boundaries of the highly regarded Palmerton Area School District.  Towamensing has an active youth sports program, and it is the first township in Carbon County to institute a policy to preserve its historic structures.  You will find the township to be a dynamic location with friendly people whether you are planning a July afternoon visit or a permanent move here.
The Supervisors, Staff and Crew want to thank you in advance for your cooperation!
