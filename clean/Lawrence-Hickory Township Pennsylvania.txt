2375 Eastbrook Road
9:00 AM - 12:00 PMHickory Township is located in Lawrence County, Pennsylvania.  The township was settled in 1798 and incorporated from Neshannock Township in 1859-1860.  We are a small, rural community covering 16.1 square miles with a population of 2,470.  Our close proximity to the I-79 and I-376 corridors is attractive to Pittsburghers who would prefer country to big city living with an approximate 60 minute commute.  Laurel School District is located within the township.  Home to the Lawrence County Fairgrounds and Spartan Park, we are a mix of serene agriculture, residential, conservation, light industrial, and mixed use (small business) areas.  A short ride to our north will open the door to Amish country, the quaint village of Volant, and beautiful Westminster College in New Wilmington.   The health, welfare and safety of our residents is of utmost importance and we are protected by the Hickory Township Volunteer Fire Department and the part-time Hickory Township Police Department.  bottom of page
