Trash & Recycling
Zoning Hearing Board Meeting - Wednesday - 6/14/2023 - 7pm (if required)
Spring is brush fire season in our region. Area fields are full of dry crop residue, wooded areas are covered in dry leaves and yards havenât turned green yet. The mixture of low humidity, high winds and plenty of available items on the ground to burn can make for a very dangerous situation. The Township monitors weather conditions daily and may place a temporary restriction on burning until conditions improve. Please be aware that while Spring is historically the most common time of year for burn bans, they can be enacted at any time as a result of drought or other weather related events.
The Township will once again hold a recycling day at the Weisenberg Volunteer Fire Department on April 8th from 9am to 11am or until the truck is full.  Please click below for the flyer.
