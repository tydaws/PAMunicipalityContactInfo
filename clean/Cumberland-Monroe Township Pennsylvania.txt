TAX INFORMATION
If you file a paper return, also file as soon as you can (January or February). This is important if you have a balance due and pay by check, because your check will be processed quickly. If you wait until mid-March or later, when the bulk of returns are filed, the processing time for your check will be longer.
Public Safety
The Earned Income Tax is collected by the Cumberland County Tax Bureau located at 12 Waterford Drive, just west of the high school. Here are some tips for filing your return and some additional information about the Bureau.
