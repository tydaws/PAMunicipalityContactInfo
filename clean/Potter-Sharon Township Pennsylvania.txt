My name is Neil Jones and I am the Sharon Township Zoning Inspector. I have held this position since 1996. I became involved with the township and zoning because I wanted to help preserve the beauty and rural character of Sharon Township. Through zoning and volunteer work, I feel I have helped make Sharon Township a nice place to live.

I am a graduate of Highland High School, Class of 1989 and have previously served as a Founding Trustee for the Highland Foundation for Educational Excellence for a time period of roughly 8 years.
  
I’m Melissa Hydel and I have been the Sharon Township Zoning Clerk and Assistant Zoning Inspector since 2000. My family moved to Sharon Township in 1998 in order to enjoy the beauty of Sharon Township. We love the rural atmosphere of Sharon Township while still being close to city amenities. Through my job and volunteer work, I have enjoyed getting to know the residents of the community.
