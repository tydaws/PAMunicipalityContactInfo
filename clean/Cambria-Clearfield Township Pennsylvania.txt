Clearfield County was created in 1804, from parts of Huntingdon and Lycoming Counties and named for Clearfield Creek. The creek’s name alluded to openings or “clear-fields” made by the large number of bison in the area. For many years Clearfield County functioned as part of Centre County, not electing its own commissioners until 1812. It was organized for judicial purposes in 1822. Clearfield, the county seat, was incorporated as a borough in 1840.
