Known primarily for developing the oldest waterworks in the United States, Heidelberg Township boasts some of the most fertile farmland in Pennsylvania. Part of this land was set aside by the Pennsylvania Game Commission and is shared with neighboring Lancaster County. That area, known as Middle Creek Wildlife Management Area, consists of more than 5,000 acres that provides habitat for waterfowl, farmland and forest wildlife, and includes a 400-acre shallow water lake.
