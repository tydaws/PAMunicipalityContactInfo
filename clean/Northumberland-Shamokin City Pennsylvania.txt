Whaleback is located in Shamokin, PA off a dead-end road called Bear Valley Avenue. Drive down this road until it changes to dirt and then it gets rough and goes up hill; some may want to park at that point. However if you drive carefully as I did you can make it all the way without four wheel drive.  Once at the top of the hill the dirt road gets wider look to your left you should see the Whaleback. Stop and park here and look for a dirt bike trail heading down hill towards the rock formation. Follow the trail to the base of the rock.
