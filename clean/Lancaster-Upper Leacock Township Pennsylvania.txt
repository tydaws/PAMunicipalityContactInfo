What is MS4?The Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System, or MS4, is a network of inlets, pipes, swales, outlets, and other features designed to control runoff from public streets, sidewalks, and other impervious areas. Eventually, the runoff discharges into several specific bodies of water including streams, ponds, lakes, wetlands or rivers.Upper Leacock Township has two main watersheds, the Conestoga River Watershed and the Mill Creek Watershed. You can view the map below to see which watershed you reside in.(click map to enlarge)Lancaster County has over 1,400 miles of streams crossing its vast landscape which flow from northeast to southwest through the county and enter the Susquehanna River. Along the way, these streams are bombarded with numerous pollution sources such as pesticides, fertilizers, animal waste, car oil, etc. All these components can affect the overall water quality of the stream. Occasionally these waterways cannot handle various sources of pollution and can become impaired or degraded. The state of Pennsylvania has identified the Conestoga River and the Mill Creek impaired by excessive amounts of nutrients and sediment.How You Can HelpThe easiest way to help prevent these streams from being polluted is to avoid straightening or constricting any flowing streams you encounter. Also, avoid mowing vegetation directly next to a stream as it reduces the ability of filtering pollutants before they enter the water body. To learn more ways to help our flowing streams, please read these articles posted below:DEP's MS4 WebpageEPA's MS4 WebpageCenter for Watershed ProtectionAlliance for the Chesapeake BaySusquehanna River Basin CommissionLancaster County WatershedsRETTEW Ms4Conserving and Protecting Our Water SupplyLawn Care MaintenanceHousehold Hazard WasteHome Owner's Guide to Storm Water

Drought Conservation MeasuresKeep an empty container near all sinks. Put it under the faucet while waiting for water to warm up. Pour any leftover water from cooking or drinking into it. Once full, use the water for gardening.Place a bucket in the shower to catch water that is wasted while waiting for the shower to warm up.Take dirty water from birdbaths, flower vases or pet dishes and reuse on potted plants.Instead of using hot water to defrost foods, defrost foods in the refrigerator overnight or use a microwave.When it rains, leave buckets outside to collect water for washing cars and watering plants and gardens.If phosphate detergents or bleach are not used in the wash, rinse water from the washing machine can be used on the garden.Position downspouts, with extensions if needed, so rain water runs onto the lawn or into the garden, not down the walk or driveway.If a dehumidifier exists, use the water it collects to water plants and gardens.If a water softener exists, use the regenerated wastewater to water the lawn and plants.*Information gained from a Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection fact sheet.
        With the recent flooding, it's more important than ever to not hook your sump pump into the sewer tank.Thank you!
