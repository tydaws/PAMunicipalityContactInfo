The Township is actively involved in meeting statutory permitting requirements under state and federal law. The water that soaks into the ground becomes part of the groundwater. For the residents who get their water from wells, or our public water supplies, this becomes your drinking water. The Township is therefore developing a variety of programs and strategies to enhance water quality through plantings, mowing strategies, implementation of stormwater management facilities and other "best management practices" (BMPs).

Hempfield was one of the original townships of the county and included the present land areas of East Hempfield, West Hempfield and Manor Townships, and the Boroughs of Columbia, Mountville, and East Petersburg.
In 1999, federal regulations extended coverage of the NPDES program to Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4’s) serving populations less than 100,000. West Hempfield Township is an MS4 community and as such is required to comply with the NPDES program. Under the NPDES stormwater program, the Township is required to develop a stormwater management program that provides the details of how the community will comply with the requirements of the permit. Permits are based on a framework of six minimum control measures:

We need your help to make a positive impact on our environment and the water that is so important to us all.  Stormwater originates from rainfall and other precipitation that runs off of surfaces all over the Township - rooftops, streets, construction sites, lawns, fields, etc. Stormwater makes its way either along the surface or soaks into the ground. The surface water flows into swales, storm drains, and other natural water courses. As this water moved toward the streams and rivers, it will pick up loose things on the ground with it. This can include pollutants, sediment, leaves, trash, etc.
