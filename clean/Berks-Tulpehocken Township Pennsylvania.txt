MAY 10 BOARD OF SUPERVISORS MEETING AGENDA
HOME
Dowload the notice.
Toilet paper is made to disintegrate. Everything else should go in the trash. Because it’s NOT flushable and won’t breakdown. Wipes and paper towels will tangle into a big lump and block sewer lines. If a pipe in your neighborhood is blocked, sewage could back up into your house which means a very expensive $$ mess for you.
