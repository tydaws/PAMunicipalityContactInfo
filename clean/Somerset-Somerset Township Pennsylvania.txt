Somerset Township is waving fees; however, Somerset Township Residents MUST provide proof of residency—driver’s license and/or current utility bill.
Municipal Authority
As we see increased trash around Somerset Township we are encouraging residents to start litter cleanup events in their neighborhoods to help keep Somerset Township Green.  This is as simple as heading outdoors with a small group of family, friends, co-workers and club members and bagging up trash.  Even a small event makes an immediate impact.
