The St. Clair Township Chief of Police generates monthly police reports.  The first report was created for May 2021.  The reports contain a lot of great information.  There is a high level overview, a reports pie chart, fuel and mileage statistics, and then a complaints log broken down by the areas (St. Clair Township, Seward, and New Florence).  It finishes with a count of calls received for the department.  The monthly reports are presented to the New Florence borough council at their meetings.  These reports can be viewed below.
The Westmoreland County Department of Safety would like everyone to know that you can now TEXT to 9-1-1 for help in an emergency.  Please see the flyer below for more information on how this service works.

A second option to get rid of unwanted prescription drugs is to use the drop off box that’s located in the Johnstown City Hall building at 401 Main Street in Johnstown.  The box is easily reached in the first-floor lobby of the building.  Due to COVID-19 restrictions, please use the Market Street entrance.  The box is accessible Monday through Friday from 8 am to 4:30 pm.  Also, there are several 30-minute free parking areas right in front of the entrance.  This makes it very easy to use this facility.

Department Personnel (Updated 4 Nov 2022)
Every year there is a National Prescription Drug Take Back Day.  Did you know residents of the area have two easy ways to get rid of unused, expired, or unwanted prescription medication.  The first is through the St. Clair Township Police Department.  The department inherited a secure prescription drug drop off box from the now defunct New Florence Police Department.  That box is accessible to area residents in the St. Clair Township building in Seward at 550 Seward Street.  The box can be accessed when either the township secretary is working or if a township police officer is in the building.  Please call first to check if someone is in.  The secretary can be reached at 814-446-5211 and the police department at 814-446-4261.

Budgets
Calendar 
The St. Clair Township Board of Supervisors are continuing to grow their police department.  Personnel may be added in the future depending upon the need and Seward’s and New Florence’s participation in a cooperative agreement beyond the initial trial term.  Under the agreement, the police are treating New Florence, Seward, and St. Clair Township as one single coverage area.  Details such as monthly summary reports and policing priorities are still being worked out.  Speeding, use of jake brakes, and illegal drug usage are concerns of the New Florence borough council that will be addressed.  Ordinance violations within New Florence will not be addressed by the St. Clair Township Police Department.  Administrative questions regarding police coverage in New Florence should be sent to the New Florence borough office at 724-235-2000 or the borough email at secretary1@nfborough.comcastbiz.net.  Administrative questions concerning the St. Clair Township Police Department should be sent to the St. Clair Township supervisors at 814-446-5211.  Please keep in mind that calling either office will not result in the dispatching of an officer.  Residents must be aware that calling an office is not a substitute for calling 911 or the Westmoreland County non-emergency number.  Thank you.

The St. Chair Township Police Department in it’s current form started in 2021.  It is unknown if a yearly summary will be generated at this time.  The police department also changed report formats this past fall so creating a combined summary report may be difficult.  Please check back after the first of the year to see if a master yearly summary was created.
