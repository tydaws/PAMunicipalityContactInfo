Antis Township has an ordinance that regulates both municipal waste collection and disposal, and recycling. These ordinances were enacted on December 22, 1986. Each resident chooses what municipal waste company will service them. If you belong to a homeowners association, contact them for information on waste removal arrangements within your development. Recycling is voluntary in the Township and most waste haulers offer recycling pick up. The township provides containers for the township residents to use to encourage recycling. These containers can be picked up at the municipal building during business hours.
