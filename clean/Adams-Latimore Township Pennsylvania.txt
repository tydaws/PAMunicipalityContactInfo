Zoning encourages certain development to create an attractive community, while also preserving natural and historic features and to assist in flood control and farmland preservation. The zoning ordinance and the zoning map establish standards and delineate the boundaries of the specific districts created in the ordinance.

Latimore Township began a volunteer recycling program in 1990 and became the first Adams County community to introduce a volunteer township-sponsored recycling program. Since that time, it has become the home of a successful recycling center and continues to be run by volunteers. If you are interested in lending a hand, please contact the Recycling Coordinator, Sam Giardullo at (717) 712-4530. All proceeds are donated to the Adams County Rescue Mission. The recycling building is open every Saturday from 10:00 AM to 12:00 Noon (except Holidays). Please see the Accepted List of Recyclables and the Waste Management Schedule.
