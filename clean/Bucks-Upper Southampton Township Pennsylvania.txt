Whose earned income tax will be withheld by their employer?Any individual working in a jurisdiction that levies the tax on residents and non-residents will have the tax withheld by their employer. If you work in a jurisdiction that does NOT tax non-residents, your employer is only required to withhold for those individuals who live in that jurisdiction. Occasionally, employers located in a jurisdiction where the tax is not levied will volunteer to withhold if your resident jurisdiction levies the tax.

Taxes 
What is the "Earned Income Tax?"The Earned Income Tax, commonly called a "Wage Tax," is usually a tax of one percent (1%) on gross wages and/or net profits from a business or profession. Typically, individuals who receive "earned income," including salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses, incentive payments, fees, tips and/or other compensation for services rendered, whether in cash or property, are subject to the tax. In addition, those who conduct businesses, professions and other activities for profit must pay tax on the net profit derived from their operation after deductions have been made of all costs and expenses incurred in conducting said business.

DOMICILE - The place where one lives and has his permanent home, and to which he has the intention of returning whenever he is absent. Actual residence is not necessarily domicile, for domicile is the fixed place of abode which, in the intention of the taxpayer, is permanent rather than transitory. Domicile is the voluntary fixed place of habitation of a person, not for a mere special or limited purpose, but with the present intention of making a permanent home, until some event occurs to induce him to adopt some other permanent home. In the case of businesses, or association, the domicile is that place considered as the center of business affairs and the place where its functions are discharged.

State law mandates businesses to recycle. This law has been in effect since 1988. There are also economic and environmental reasons. Why send something to a landfill if it can be reused? Recycling saves money and resources, and reduces disposal costs. Reducing trash lowers disposal costs. There are companies that purchase recyclable material.
Latex (water-based) paint may be placed in the trash for regular collection. Please allow the unused paint to harden to prevent it from spilling onto the street during collection.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
