GRIER CITY â€” Ryan Township Secretary Lori A. Feldish-Ludinsky reported at this weekâ€™s supervisors meeting that progress is being made in creating an official website for the township.A comment made during public discussion at the June meeting brought the idea to life, and it has grown. Although still in its early stages, ryantwp.org will soon be a home for community/local events, documents for permits and more.Legislation recently signed into law that updated the stateâ€™s Open Records Law was noted. It requires that state government agencies, school districts and municipalities post their agendas at least 24 hours in advance on or near the municipal building or online. The update goes into effect Aug. 29.Those affected must also make copies of the agenda available at their meetings, listing items that will be or may be the subject of deliberation.In another matter at Mondayâ€™s meeting, some confusion regarding the recently enacted recycling ordinance was clarified by the township.

All recycling should be placed in the bin that was provided and Thomas Enterprises Inc. will not remove other recyclable items that are placed around the bin.Even though the new ordinance has been a learning curve, attending residents were pleased overall with the program, the township reported.Also, the supervisors are awaiting more information from Mahanoy Township regarding the possibility of working jointly regarding bonds for the NorthPoint Development LLC project, which will be in both townships.NorthPoint plans to construct three buildings near Interstate 81 and Route 54 under a Local Economic Revitalization Tax Assistance program.
