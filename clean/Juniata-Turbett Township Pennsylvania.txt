That depends on the image or clip you've selected.Most creative stock photos, illustrations, vectors and video clips come with a royalty-free (RF) licence. This type of license allows you to use a file for advertising, websites, blogs, presentations, video productions, podcasts and more, as many times as you want, worldwide (within the terms of our content license agreement).Note: RF images with a yellow "Editorial use only" banner cannot be used for commercial, promotional, advertorial or endorsement purposes. You can use filters to exclude these images from your results.Rights-managed editorial images and rights-ready video clips, on the other hand, are based on how, where and for how long you will use the content. Since you're paying only for that specific use, you can't use the image or video in additional projects without purchasing additional licences.

Subcontractors.

What types of licenses does Getty Images offer? Getty Images offers three types of license models: royalty-free ("RF"), rights-ready ("RR") and rights-managed ("RM"). Royalty-free does not mean there is no cost for the license. Instead, royalty-free means that the license fee is paid once and there is no need to pay additional royalties if the content is re-used. Royalty-free content is licensed for worldwide, unlimited, perpetual use, and pricing is based on the file size. Rights-managed and rights-ready content is licensed for specific types of use, and pricing is based on factors such as size, placement, duration of use, and geographic distribution.
