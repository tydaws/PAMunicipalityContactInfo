The history of Upper Fairfield Township begins in 1851 when some dissatisfied citizens of the southern portion of Fairfield Township asked to be separated from the neighbors to the north. They alleged that the township was so large that assessors and collectors were inconvenienced by being compelled to travel long distances. Upper Fairfield Township was called Pollock Township during its first two years of existence. It was named for Judge James Pollock, president of the district court that ordered the township to be divided, and a controversial figure at the time. After two years the people became dissatisfied with the name of Pollock, on account of his politics, and appealed to the legislature for a new name. This was granted by the passage of an act, January 29, 1853, declaring that hereafter the township "shall be known by the name of Upper Fairfield." The township is bounded on the east by Mill Creek, on the north by Plunkett's Creek, on the west by Eldred and Loyalsock, and on the south by Fairfield, the parent township. It is the twenty-second in size in the county and contains 11, 200 acres.
