(2) The portion of the Miller Road roadway traversing the floodplain area is an elevated embankment, and the roadway area is located above (beyond) the limit of the floodplain. The replacement of the culvert will be undertaken within the “footprint” of the elevated roadway embankment area without direct impact to the adjacent mapped floodplain areas. Furthermore, adjacent wetland areas located within the floodplain will not be directly impacted by the culvert replacement project. Potential indirect impacts will be fully addressed through the PA DEP permit process as outlined below.

(1) Alternatives to locating the project in a floodplain/wetland area.
This is to give notice that the County of Erie, on behalf of Girard Township, has conducted an evaluation of the multi-year funded Girard Township Miller Road Replacement Project as required by Executive Orders 11988 and 11990 in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR 55.20 Subpart C Procedures for Making Determinations on Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands. The proposed project involves replacement of the Miller Road culvert over Brandy Run.

Purpose of Project: The existing Miller Road culvert crossing over Brandy Run is in poor condition with areas of significant structural failure, and the culvert must be replaced. If the existing culvert pipe is not replaced, the structural condition will continue to decline to the point of complete structural failure. In addition to causing the closure of Miller Road, the failure of the existing culvert will likely involve collapse into Brandy Run, which will have negative impacts to the environmental condition and floodplain area of Brandy Run and adjacent sensitive natural areas.
(4) The existing Miller Road culvert crossing over Brandy Run is in poor condition with areas of significant structural failure, and the culvert must be replaced. The structure type (corrugated metal pipe arch), and structural condition of the culvert is such that suitable repair of the existing culvert is not achievable. Therefore, complete replacement of the existing culvert is proposed. If the existing culvert pipe is not replaced, the structural condition will continue to decline to the point of complete structural failure. In addition to causing the closure of Miller Road, the failure of the existing culvert will likely involve collapse into Brandy Run, which will have negative impacts to the environmental condition and floodplain area of Brandy Run and adjacent sensitive natural areas. Therefore, the mitigation measure that provides the least impact to the Brandy Run floodplain, associated stream and wetland areas, and flow patterns is replacement of the existing culvert pipe with a new culvert pipe.

PROJECT SUMMARY
(1) Because the project involves the in-kind replacement of the existing culvert structure with a new structure, the project must be undertaken in the proposed location. The structure type (corrugated metal pipe arch), and structural condition of the culvert is such that suitable repair of the existing culvert is not achievable. Therefore, complete replacement of the existing culvert is proposed.
The Girard Township Office will be closed Monday August 8th through Wednesday August 10th so that staff can attend a conference.
