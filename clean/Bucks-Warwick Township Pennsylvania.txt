Non-commercial keeping of livestock on residential properties in Warwick TownshipWithin the Agricultural, Conservation, Rural Estate and R-1 zoning districts, noncommercial keeping of livestock is permitted on properties between 3 and 9.99 acres by special exception, subject to the criteria below (the fee for a zoning hearing to consider a special exception application is $400). Non-commercial keeping of livestock is not permitted in other zoning districts.A. The minimum lot area shall be three acres, except that the keeping of a "working horse" (e.g., a horse used as the principal mode of transport for the occupants of the property) shall require no less than one acre per horse. The keeping of a combination of animal types (Group 1, 2 and 3) shall be limited to an animal density equal to the ratio of the number of animals, by type. In no case shall a lot contain more than 50 total animals. The following list specifies additional area requirements by size of animals kept:(1) Group 1. Animals whose average adult weight is less than 10 pounds shall be permitted at an animal density of 12 per acre, with a maximum number of 50 animals.(2) Group 2. Animals whose average adult weight is between 10 and 65 pounds shall be permitted at an animal density of two per acre, with a maximum number of 20 animals.(3) Group 3. Animals whose average adult weight is greater than 65 pounds shall be permitted at an animal density of one per acre. No more than five Group 3 animals are permitted.B. The following lists minimum setbacks (from all property lines) imposed upon the placement of any structure used to house noncommercial livestock. Should one structure be used to house a combination of animal types, the most restrictive setback shall apply:(1) Group 1 Animals.(a) Up to 25 animals, a twenty-five-foot setback.(b) Above 25 animals, a fifty-foot setback.(2) Group 2 Animals.(a) Up to two animals, a fifty-foot setback.(b) Above two animals, a seventy-five-foot setback.(3) Group 3 Animals.(a) Seventy-five feet.C. All structures used to house noncommercial livestock shall be prohibited from placement in the front yard.D. All outdoor pasture/recreation areas shall be enclosed with fencing to prevent the escape of the animals; such fencing must be set back at least 10 feet from all property lines.E. All animal wastes shall be properly stored and disposed of, so as not to be objectionable at the site's property line. All animals, their housing and their outdoor pasture/recreation areas shall be properly maintained so as not to become a nuisance to adjoining properties.Any parcel of land within 10 or more acres which is used in the raising of agricultural products, livestock, poultry or dairy products, including necessary farm structures and the storage of equipment customarily incidental to the primary use are considered a farm and must follow the appropriate regulations relating to farm animal operations.
