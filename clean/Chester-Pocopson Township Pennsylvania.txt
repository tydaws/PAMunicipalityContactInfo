Pocopson Township
Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) routinely collects travel volume information in the nine counties comprising the Philadelphia metropolitan area.   Counts are typically collected at the request of your state DOT to fulfill Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) program requirements, at the request of the county planning/engineering office, or in support of planning staff evaluating transportation system performance or improvements.  This involves DVRPC staff laying a rubber tube across roadway facilities for approximately 48 hours (to gather daily traffic volumes), mounting video cameras, or manually recording traffic from a vehicle parked near an intersection (to gather turning movement information).  These efforts will not interfere with normal traffic operations on these facilities.
