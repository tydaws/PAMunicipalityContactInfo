    The original township was then again divided into East and South Huntingdon Townships. This was in 1798. The present boundaries of the township are: north by Sewickley; northeast by Hempfield; east by East Huntingdon Township: south by Fayette County, and on the west by the Youghiogheny River. The surface of the township is diversified, part of it being hilly and part quite level. It contains vast deposits of bituminous coal, which has been developed over the years. The Pittsburgh and Connellsville Railroad runs along the Youghiogheny River spanning the entire length of the township, and it affords a splendid outlet for the transportation of coal. Currently, the township road department maintains nearly 70 miles of roads. *
