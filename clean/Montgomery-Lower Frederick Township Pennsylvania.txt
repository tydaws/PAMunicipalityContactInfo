We don’t have a firm answer yet, but if all continues according to plan the pump station start-up and testing would begin at the end of June or early July.  This is a construction project, so bad weather, subcontractor schedules, or other unforeseen circumstances may change this timeline.
Your plumber can work with you to evaluate if the house basement can be served by a gravity flow connection, or if other options need to be considered.
The existing septic tank or tanks must be pumped clean.  You should confirm if your plumber will pump out the tank, or if you must directly contract with a septic tank service.

Email List for Updates: If you would like to receive updates on this project, please email manager@lowerfrederick.org and ask to placed on the email list for the Fulmer/Riverside Sewer Extension Project.
It is important that you contact your plumbing contractor to assess if the proposed lateral stub location is suitable for your home or if there is a more desirable location on your property for the lateral stub to be placed. For example, another location may work better with where the plumbing currently leaves your home or may reduce impacts from excavation to existing landscaping, driveways, or natural features.   DO NOT MOVE THE SURVEY STAKE!

Generally, no.  Fulmer and Riverside may gain inches on one side or the other during restoration, but no formal road widening is planned, no additional trees or shrubs are scheduled for removal.  The exception is at the intersection of Riverside and Bavington, where limited widening is planned to accommodate traffic that will build and service the new pump station.

At Mid-April, Doli Construction is working on building the pump station just off Riverside Avenue.  Meanwhile, road restoration is planned for the coming months.  Road paving will be performed after the pump station work is substantially complete.
The Pump Station must be constructed.

The paving of Fulmer and Riverside may raise the road surface (± 2 inches) in many locations.  The white paint marks the possible extent of “transition pavement” to transition from your existing driveway to the newly paved street.  The mark was placed during quantity estimation with temporary marking paint.  It will wash or wear away in weeks.

The sewer line may be 10 feet deep in front of your property, but you need less depth to service your home.  We can work with your plumber on depth so he does not need to do excess digging, possible reducing your cost.

Property owners with house numbers 17 through 113 Fulmer Road and 240 through 264 Fulmer Road can expect a letter from the Township in coming days regarding sewer lateral location. The Township will have a stake placed along the front of each property by a surveyor. The stakes will identify the proposed design location of the sewer lateral stubs. We ask that you do not relocate or remove these stakes.
The service laterals out to each property are being installed. A cleanout is installed at the end of each lateral, which is where your plumber will connect your plumbing to the new collection system.

All this will take months.  Timing will depend on weather conditions, how much rock the contractor encounters, and many other factors.  It is likely that the project will not be ready for any connections until well into the Spring of 2023.
