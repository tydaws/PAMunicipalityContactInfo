There is a crime wave sweeping the nation. You could be a victim and not even know it yet. Or perhaps you have already been victimized and know firsthand how damaging this particular crime can be. It’s an easy crime to commit-the payoff is usually significant and apprehension of the criminal by police or enforcement agencies can be very difficult, many times impossible. It’s not usually violent in nature but just as damaging. It’s called Identity Theft and it is the fastest growing criminal act in the nation.Identity theft occurs when the “thief” uses your name, date of birth, address, social security number or virtually any other type of identifying type information to commit crimes against your credit. The thieves are able to assume control of your existing assets, such as bank accounts. In many cases, thieves will open new accounts or obtain loans using your information. Many times the victim is unaware of the frauds that have been committed against his/her credit until they are applying for a loan themselves-and declined. . The West Caln Police Department has handled numerous and increasing complaints over the past several years pertaining to Identity Theft. We will diligently pursue your complaint to the best of our ability should you become a victim, however, prevention is key with this crime.
