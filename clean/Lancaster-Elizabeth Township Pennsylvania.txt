This Warwick Emergency Services Alliance (WESA) was established in 2001 with 10 member organizations. This was a partnership of local government and volunteer emergency service providers dedicated to the continued support and success of the volunteer community for the region it represents. In the summer of 2013, the partner municipalities of the Warwick Emergency Services Alliance adopted an Amended and Restated Intermunicipal Agreement that created a commission of individuals representing each of the emergency services providers and the municipalities. This newly created organization is the Warwick Emergency Services Commission (WESC). The members continue to promote and ensure the present and future vitality of our region’s volunteer emergency response organizations.

2023 Notices
Available at Township Office:
Today, Elizabeth Township is a quiet rural community, devoted largely to agricultural, recreational and residential uses. The Township’s largest village is Brickerville. Some other smaller villages include Elm, Poplar Grove and Lexington.
The area now comprising Elizabeth Township played an important part in the development of the County in early colonial days. The village of Brickerville dates from 1741, when the area’s first blast furnace was built to make cast iron from ore from the Cornwall mines. Stiegel glass manufacturing, dating from 1757, soon grew into an international export. Iron production grew, reaching its peak about 1780 and continuing until 1856. The supplying of charcoal from area forests to feed the furnaces over this period became an important related industry.
