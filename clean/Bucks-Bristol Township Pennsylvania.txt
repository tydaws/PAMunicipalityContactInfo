The 2023 Preliminary Budget was passed at the December Township Council. No tax increase once again this year! That is now 12 years, since 2012, this Township Council has not had to increase the Township taxes! Some user fees have increases by 10%. These include the Streetlight Assessment, which for a residential homeowner will increase $2.75 annually from $27.50 to $30.25. The Refuse Fee increase is $33.00 increasing the rate from $317 to $350. The five year contract ends in 2023. We have been gathering data from surrounding municipalities who have recently entered new contracts and the amounts have double, which have caused the annual fees to double. This increase is to assist in offsetting the anticipated increase with a new contract price for 2024. Those that live and send their sanitary sewer to the Croydon Wastewater Treatment Plant System will see a sewer rate increase by 10% as well. This will be an increase of $10.94 per quarter from $100.94 to $111.03. All of this information can be view on the slides presented at the December 15th Council Meeting by clicking here. The full 2023 Budget may be viewed by clicking here.

For immediate health, safety and welfare concerns, the Randall Avenue/Edgely Bridge closes today (February 23, 2023) to all vehicular traffic. The timeline for the length of this closure is currently unknown. Bristol Township Fire Chief/Fire Marshal/Emergency Management Director Kevin Dippolito advises “changes have been made to the Fire and EMS response cards at the 9-1-1 dispatch center to ensure the closest units are sent during the bridge closure.” The Township is in the process of discussing these new bridge safety concerns with AMTRAK. Once a plan of action is agreed upon, along with a timeline, this information will be provided. The Township is also working with PennDOT on an acceptable detour route and will provide this information once it is approved. Click here to read the full Press Release.

The Township has received an approved permit from Amtrak to review the conditions under the bridge. At last night’s Council Meeting, the Township Manager gave an update advising our Engineer’s had secured the required Amtrak-approved hi-rail vehicle rental but was advised today that truck is actually not an approved truck. An Amtrak-approved vehicle will be ready for use in two weeks. At that time our Engineers will have the ability to get under the bridge and evaluate these new concerns of falling concrete. Once the inspection is completed, we will have a better understanding of action items with timelines. We thank you for your patience.
