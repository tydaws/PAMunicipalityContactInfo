            It has come to our attention that many tax payers are stating they never received their 2022 Per Capita Tax bill. We do know for a fact there was a printing error and some tax payers received two identical tax bills in separate envelopes. With that said, we do not know if there was a printing error that caused some tax payers not to receive a tax bill. Therefore, the City, School District and Berkheimer worked together to waive penalty and fees through the date of May 15, 2023.

            The 2023 Spring Hydrant Flushing Program will begin on Monday, May 1. Daytime flushing will take place between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Over time, sediment builds up on the inside of water distribution pipes (water mains), narrowing the path that water can flow through. Twice per year, the hydrants are flushed to remove any accumulated sediments from water mains and restore water flow, which helps the City to better meet the needs of homes, businesses, and Public Safety. The flushing program also helps to verify that all water supply systems work, including pumps, storage tanks...
