 Bicycle SafelyWhen warm weather is here and the kids are playing outside, let's be extra careful when driving through our residential neighborhoods.  Be alert for bicycles and other telltale signs that children are in the area.  More people are taking to the streets on their bikes.  Bike riding is a great way to both relax and stay in shape.  If you're a bike rider, remember these simple safety tips:
