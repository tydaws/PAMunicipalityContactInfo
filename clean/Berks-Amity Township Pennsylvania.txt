In order that the Township may best perform its services for the benefit of the community and the businesses therein, a centralized registry of all businesses is hereby established. Every person who shall first commence to engage in or conduct any business within the Township at any time after the first day of January of any year shall register such business within 30 days of the commencement of such business and pay the full registration fee as set by Resolution of the Board of Supervisors, provided that, when such initial registration shall take place in the month of December of any year, such registration also shall be applicable for the calendar year ensuing; provided, further, that every person who shall continue to engage in or conduct any business within the Township, at any time after the first day of January of any year shall have reregistered said business no later than the first day of March of said year and shall pay the full re-registration fee as set by Resolution of the Board of Supervisors. The initial registration or subsequent registration of a business shall be upon a form furnished by the Township, and the person shall pay the registration or re-registration fee, as the case may be, at the time of the registration or re-registration.
In addition, a concern was raised about a funding crisis in the EMS arena, the Board was asked to consider funding a portion of the cost of operations within Amity. The 2nd Class Township Code states:  Section 1553. Emergency Services (a) The township shall be responsible for ensuring that fire and emergency medical services are provided within the township by the means and to the extent determined by the township, including the appropriate financial and administrative assistance for these services. After careful consideration, the Board agreed this is a vital service within the community and recognized the need to fund the same. The adopted budget also includes a dedicated.15 mil EMS tax for funding Emergency Medical Services, this equates to $15.00 per $100k of assessed value.

Codification of Ordinances
Radon occurs naturally from the breakdown of uranium in soil and rocks and enters homes through cracks in the foundation or other openings. Due to its geology, Pennsylvania is prone to high radon levels, and has been detected in all 67 counties, with about 40 percent of homes having levels above national safety standards.

Winter is an ideal time to test, because doors and windows are generally closed, producing the most conservative results. High levels of radon tend to be found in basements, but the gas can be found anywhere in the home. Simple radon test kits are inexpensive and available at home improvement and hardware stores.
Licensing dollars support the work of the Bureau of Dog Law Enforcement, which inspects Pennsylvania’s kennels and ensures the health and well-being of the dogs that spend their lives there; investigates and prosecutes illegal kennels and bad actors; protects the public by monitoring PA’s dangerous dogs and investigating dog bites; and reunites licensed lost dogs with their families and helps unlicensed lost dogs find shelter.
