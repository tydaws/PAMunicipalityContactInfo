East Marlborough Township is responsible for the maintenance and clearing of snow on Township and State roads. In some communities, private contractors are hired to remove snow from common areas, sidewalks, etc.  Please contact your Homeowners Association for more information.  If you live in a new community in which the roads have not yet been dedicated, a private contractor will handle snow removal until such time as the Township accepts dedication of the roads.
