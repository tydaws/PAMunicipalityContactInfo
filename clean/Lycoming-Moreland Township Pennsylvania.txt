Montgomery County is taking steps to ensure your ballot is returned to Voter Services by the Election Day deadline by providing eleven (11) secure drop-off boxes located throughout the county for the public to return their completed ballots. We are encouraging constituents to drop-off their completed ballots at these secure locations instead of placing them in the mail in order to avoid their ballots being received after the deadline due to longer than usual delivery times. Completed ballots must be placed in the drop-off boxes by the time the polls close at 8 PM on Election Day, Tuesday, November 8, 2022. Please visit https://www.montcopa.org/753/Voter-Services for a complete list of hours and locations.
