Why Limited Home Rule Authority?
Change of Name or Address
The limited home rule form of government gives broader powers to townships that enact it, and it allows a township and its citizens to be more proactive in creating legislation of benefit to those within the community. Limited home rule allows townships to enact resolutions to improve the health, safety and welfare of its citizens.
