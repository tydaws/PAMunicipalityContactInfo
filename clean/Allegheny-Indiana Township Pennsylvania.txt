Over 27,000 tons of usable building material goes to Allegheny County landfills each year. You can play a part in reducing that amount by donating to Construction Junction. Construction Junction, a non-profit retail store where used and surplus building materials, including usable paint, lumber, cabinets and ceramic or vinyl floor tiles, are collected and resold to consumers is located at 214 North Lexington Street in Point Breeze. For more information call 412-243-5025 or visit their website.
The following items are recyclable: ALL papers (newsprint/phone books/magazines/corrugated, etc.), Glass (beverage and food containers only), Plastics #1 – #7 (Food, beverage, shampoo bottles, etc.), Tin, and Aluminum (food and beverage containers). THESE ITEMS CAN ALL BE PLACED IN YOUR NEW 65 GALLON GREEN AND YELLOW RECYCLING BIN. Do not forget to place the container with the lid opening towards the street with a minimum of three feet between each container and/or other objects. Also, there is NO need to put your container out each week if it is only partially full. You may wait until the container is full and then put it out for collection.
