Our logo, designed by John Watkins of Watkins Architect Ltd., depicts several aspects of Richmond's history.  An outline of the Township is flanked by a grist stone, paying homage to the prevelance of the local milling industry.  The logo also features a tractor in a field and a line of green trees.  Those details celebrate Richmond Township's agriculture roots.Announcements14953 Kutztown Rd.
