If your house is on a slab foundation, investigate a low floodwall berm or “dry floodproofing” i.e. making the walls watertight and closing all the openings when a flood comes.

Any house in Bloomsburg can be covered by a flood insurance policy. Detached garages and accessory buildings are covered under the policy for the main building. There are two types of coverage which can be purchased separately.STRUCTURAL Covers everything that stays with a house when it is sold, including the furnace, cabinets, built in appliances and wall to wall carpeting.CONTENTS Covers furniture and other personal possessions except for money, valuable papers and the like. There is no coverage for things outside the house like the driveway and landscaping. If you have a policy check it closely. You may only have structural coverage (because that’s all that banks require).Don’t wait for the next flood to buy flood insurance. There is a 30 day waiting period before NFIP coverage takes effect.

An excellent source for more information is Homeowner’s Guide to Retrofitting: (FEMA Publication 312). It can be read at the Bloomsburg Public Library (225 Market Street), ordered (for free) from the Federal Emergency Management Agency by calling 800-480-2520.No matter what kind of building you have, some last-minute emergency measures can always help. For example, you could move valuable items (photos, antiques, and other “irreplaceables” etc.) or items that are most damaged by floodwaters (upholstered furniture, stuffed toys, mattresses, etc.) up to a higher level. You can place sandbags or plastic sheeting in front of doorways and other low entry points. Whatever emergency protec­tion measures you use, it is always best to have a plan written in advance to make sure you don’t forget anything after you hear the flood warning. Keep in mind the flood safety hints in the preceding section. The Red Cross has some additional suggestions. The substantial damage requirements are explained in more detail in Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings.

Third, several of the Town’s efforts depend on your cooperation and assistance. Here is how you can help:Do not dump or throw anything into the channels or drainage ways. Even grass clippings and branches can accumulate and plug channels. A plugged channel cannot carry water and when it rains the water has to go somewhere. Every piece of trash contributes to flooding.You can do your part in helping the drainage system work. Sweep or pick up your gutters to prevent blockages in the storm sewers. Pick up trash and fallen branches in the ditches.If you see dumping or debris in the channels or drainage ways, contact the Public Works Department at 570-784-2300.Always check with the Code Enforcement and Zoning Officer before you build on, alter, regrade, or fill on your property. A permit may be needed to ensure that projects do not cause problems on other properties.If you see a building or filling without a permit sign posted, contact the Code Enforcement and Zoning Office at 570-784-7703.

 The Floodplain in Bloomsburg was created by the Susquehanna River on the south and Fishing Creek on the north and west boundaries of the Town. Their levels rise and fall. When they rise above flood stage, they can cover up to 1/3 of the landmass within the Town’s Boundaries.Floods on the Susquehanna River and Fishing Creek can be caused by heavy rain, snowmelt, or ice jams. On Fishing Creek they can come with little or no warning. Floods can stay up for several days, isolating areas and causing increased damage to property. Check the Bloomsburg Flood Gauge.

If you have a basement, split level, or other floors below ground level, there are lots of ways to protect your basement or lower floor from seepage and sewer backup. 
If your house is on a crawl space or basement foundation, a low floodwall berm or “wet floodproofing” will work. This is moving all items subject to damage out of harm’s way so water can flow into the crawlspace or basement and not cause any problems. For a more effective measure, it is relatively easy to elevate the building to get the first floor above the flood level.

The ordinance requires that all substantial improvements to a building will require the entire building to be treated as a new building. A substantial improvement is when the value of an addition, alteration, repair, or reconstruction project exceeds 50% of the value of the existing building. In the case of an addition, only the addition must be protected. In the case of an improvement to the original building, the entire building must be protected from future substantial damages.
