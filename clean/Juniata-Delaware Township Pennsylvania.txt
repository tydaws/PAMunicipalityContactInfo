MEETINGS
DINGMANS FERRY -- Delaware Township residents and their neighbors in Lehman and Dingman townships may have a shorter, quicker and less costly for the gas tank drive to receive basic medical care in the near future. A medical clinic has been proposed for Delaware Plaza in Route 739 that would unite four vacant storefronts adjacent to the Weis Market that opened in late 2020. It is part of the 10,000 square feet of retail space adjacent to the supermarket. Charles B. Miller, president of Center Point Properties purchased the site back in 2019. Delaware Township Solicitor Thomas Farley said he understands that Northwell Health, headquartered in Long Island, has leased the four storefronts. Supervisors at their regular meeting on Wednesday last week approved a public hearing on the proposal at 7:15 p.m. during their regular May 24 meeting for what was termed in the motion a "conditional use." Supervisor Rick Koehler and Len Glamann, chairman of the township's Planning Commission, said it actually is more of a "change of use" to convert the property from retail to medical use. Koehler, vice chairman of the board, conducted the meeting in the absence of board Chairman John Henderson, who was home with a medical issue. Henderson is expected back at the next scheduled Board of Supervisors meeting on May 10. The proposed change to the property would help residents avoid going to an emergency room unit at Wayne Memorial Hospital or one of two hospitals in Monroe County or another in New Jersey or calling for an ambulance service for many basic services. Pike is the only county in the state without a hospital. An urgent care medical unit currently is about 15 miles away in on Route 209 in Middle Smithfield Township, with licensed medical staff servicing patients with medical ailments such as viruses, including the COVID-19 virus, the flu and bronchial conditions and serving those who need medical exams. "It seems like a win-win, something that's been long overdue," said Farley, when residents asked about the hearing. In a recent meeting Lehman Pike EMS Administrator Sue Duffy had with Lehigh Valley Health Care network representatives regarding that township's ambulance corps. Duffy said she was told Lehigh Valley has been studying southern Pike County for an emergency care hub, but not a hospital, based on the high call volume. Also during the regular meeting, Akenac Park use requests by the Dingmans Ferry Theatre were approved for Sept. 21 through 30 and Oct. 1 for the theatre cabin in Akenac Park, pending receipt of all required paperwork. Dennis Lee, head of the Dingmans Ferry Theatre, presented an update during the workshop prior to the regular meeting and also had some questions. Lee asked if the theatre cabin would have a roof replacement as committed by the board last year. "I'd have to check," said Koehler. Lee also asked if a 20-foot by 40-foot commercial tent could be set up next to the cabin and township Roadmaster Richard Bailo said he'd look into it. Lee said he still was awaiting reimbursement, as promised, for paperwork he submitted for refurbishing the stage area with new lumber. The work cost $180 and supervisors said they would search out that submission. Supervisors approved Akenac Park septic pumping from Septic Medic at approximately $1,575 for the recreation hall and at approximately $787.50 for the park's bath house. A motion passed to approve Paolo Insigna to adopt Johnny Bee Road under the Delaware Township Adopt-a-Road program. Enid Resto was rehired as the seasonal part-time Akenac Park Supervisor at $15.50 per hour and Skyler Bower was rehired as seasonal part-time head lifeguard at Akenac Park at $13.00 per hour. During the Announcements segment of the meeting, Koehler said the township is accepting letters of interest for a vacancy on the Zoning Hearing Board. Koehler also said a Concealed Carry and Castle Doctrine Seminar will be held 6-8 p.m. on Aug. 17, at the Dingman Township Volunteer Fire Department. RSVP is required as seating is limited. Call (570) 226-5959. During the workshop, Supervisors Koehler and Joe Dunne and township Administrator Krista Predmore discussed the township's winter maintenance agreement with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation for Wilson Hill Road. "PennDOT wants us to do the entire road," said Koehler. The township has been treating the upper half of the road and PennDOT has taken the lower half off Route 209. Koehler said the condition of the lower half is a risk for damaging the township's trucks. Predmore said PennDOT is trying to force the township to take over the entire road because "they don't have enough drivers." With the winter season a half-year away, they agreed to spend more time on further discussion at upcoming meetings. Predmore also left on the front table for residents a three-page handout of the township budget for the first quarter of 2023. "We're status quo at this point," said Predmore. "We received more tax money this year than last quarter. We always try to keep things on the low side but things are getting more expensive." Total income for the quarter came in at $213,812 and total expenses at $312,608.65, a shortfall of $98,796.27. Predmore pointed out that there is a carryover of unallocated funds that would be calculated in later. The final budget for the year shows an income of $1,684,563.67 against expenses of $1,516,710.28, a surplus of just under $168,000.
