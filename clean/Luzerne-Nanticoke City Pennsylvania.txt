The arrow head on the shield symbolizes the Nanticoke Indians. The diamond shapes represent the surrounding mountains and anthracite coal in the area.Above the shield is the city name, and above that is a wreath of the state flower, Mountain Laurel, which indicates that Nanticoke is a city in Pennsylvania.Within the Mountain Laurel is a forearm, which symbolizes the industry and vigor of the people of the city. The hand is holding a banner that suggests the unity of the many ethnic groups and nationalities of the inhabitants of the city through the years.
