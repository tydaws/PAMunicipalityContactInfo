The township receives its name from Colonel Thomas Dunbar, of the 48th Irish Regiment, under command of General Braddock during the French and Indian War. Train service here began in the mid 1800's and with it came the manpower and materials that would lead to the immense amount of manufacturing in the area. This in turn led to the development of Dunbar Township. The variety of manufacturing included brick works, sand plants, quarries, glass works, woolen mills, coke ovens, and the Dunbar Iron Furnace. Many residents also worked at the local ore and coal mines.

Located in north-central Fayette County, Dunbar Township was first settled in the late 1700's. The area attracted settlers primarily from Maryland and eastern Pennsylvania. As part of the Connellsville Coke Region, Dunbar Township has a rich history in manufacturing with the earliest furnaces and coke ovens appearing in the area shortly after settlers arrived. Bordered to the north and east by the Youghiogheny River, Dunbar Township includes the unincorporated communities of Dickerson Run, Liberty, Adelaide, Juniata, Little Summit, Leisenring, West Leisenring, Trotter, Wheeler, Monarch, Dunbar & Morrell.
In addition to exploring its fascinating history and period architecture, visitors can access the Youghiogheny River Trail. This 71 mile trail is a portion of the Great Allegheny Passage that stretches from Pittsburgh to Washington D.C. Visitors also have access to the Sheepskin Trail, which is part of the rail to trail project, and will eventually connect the Great Allegheny Passage to the Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail and the West Virginia rail to trail system.
