Smoke should not enter premises unless a leak is present. This smoke is non-toxic, non-corrosive, and will not leave a stain. If smoke enters a home, it will soon dissipate. Opening doors and windows will help. Any presence of smoke within the house should be reported to the township office at 717-764-4646.
