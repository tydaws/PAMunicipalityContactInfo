CDC recommends that people ages 5 years and older receive one updated (bivalent) booster if it has been at least 2 months since their last COVID-19 vaccine dose. People who have gotten more than one original (monovalent) booster are also recommended to get an updated (bivalent) booster. Use this tool to determine when or if you (or your child) can get one or more COVID-19 boosters.

Act 32 requires municipal governments and   school districts in all Pennsylvania counties, except Philadelphia, to select a   single tax collector to serve the Earned Income Tax collection needs of the   political subdivisions.

	The University of Massachusetts Amherst School of Public Health & Health Sciences (SPHHS) has been engaged by the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC) since 2013 to carry out a comprehensive, multi-year research project, believed to be the first of its kind, on the economic and social impacts of introducing casino gambling in Massachusetts. The project fulfills Section 71 of the 2011 Expanded Gaming Act, which requires the MGC to establish “an annual research agenda” to assist in understanding the social and economic effects of the introduction of casino gambling in MA, and in making annual scientifically-based recommendations to the Legislature. In 2019, the MGC issued a subsequent request for proposals and awarded the contract to the same team, effective January 2020.
