I have lived there for 5 years and I didn't really like it at first becuase it was quite a distance away from everything that I have come to know and found comfort in.Now I love being out in the country away from the hustle and bustle of nosy neighbors and people who want to blare music latea at night. One thing that I would like to see change in the town is to being in some new development that could help the town out.Current ResidentJuly 9 2019Overall ExperienceReportStart Your Review of Middlebury TownshipRate It!Rating 3 out of 5  I live in Middlebury Center, PA but I spend most of my time in Wellsboro, PA. I would say that most of the time I enjoy living here because it is beautiful and I love the people in this town. Everyone knows one another and is kind to one another. It is one of the better places to live compared to the surrounding areas. I can only see my hometown going up from here.Niche UserJuly 8 2015Overall ExperienceReportadd-to-listAdd to ListNicheAbout UsNiche For SchoolsNiche For CollegesBlogResource CenterContact NicheDataCareersPartnershipsPressDo Not Sell My Personal InformationPrivacy PolicyUser AgreementWeb AccessibilityCookie PolicySitemapInstagramFacebookTwitterTiktokDiscordYouTube©2023 Niche.com Inc.Discover the schools, companies, and neighborhoods that are right for you.K-12CollegesGraduate SchoolsPlaces to LiveDo you work for a school or college?
