The stormwater requirements of the federal Clean Water Act are administered under the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection’s Municipal Separate Storm Sewer (MS4) Program. In December 2002, DEP issued a General Permit (“PAG-13”) for use by MS4s that fall under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II program, requiring the implementation of a stormwater management program for minimizing the impacts from runoff.As a requirement of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), Redstone Township, Fayette County has been issued by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) a General Permit PAG-13 Authorization to Discharge under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) for Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4s).  Redstone Township is a new permittee in the MS4 program.  This permit allows the Township to discharge its stormwater in accordance with the permit requirements. In accordance with the 2018-2023 Permit, Redstone Township must prepare and implement a Pollutant Reduction Plan (PRP) to reduce sediment and nutrient loadings to various streams in the Township, which are impaired due to existing sediment or nutrient loading.  For Redstone Township, impaired streams include Lilly Run, Monongahela River, and Dunlap Creek. Please click on the Stormwater tab on the side to get more educational material.
