We offer an e-mail account for reporting concerns with Township-owned property after normal business hours.  This includes problems such as a water leak at a Township park restroom, or a tree that has fallen across a public road.  After hours, on holidays, and during weekends, these issues may be submitted to afterhours@worcestertwp.com.  This e-mail account is monitored at all times.
