You have been summoned for jury service during a most extraordinary time. Jury duty is important because it safeguards one of the most crucial rights of the American legal system. As trials continue to take place, the court must continue to rely on civic-minded jurors like you for help in ensuring fairness and providing impartial viewpoints in cases. Operating a judicial system during a worldwide pandemic requires sacrifice, collaboration, and creativity. Jury trials are among the most important work of the court. The constitutional right to a jury trial does not end with a pandemic, and trials cannot happen without jurors. Your potential role as a juror could not be more critical; however, we understand that your ability to serve may be impacted by the pandemic. Please refer to the green sheet contained in this mailing for excusal and deferral information. If you have not been deferred or excused, please appear as directed in your summons.
