            It was named after the city of Derry by Scotch-Irish settlers.           
Derry Township is governed by three Supervisors elected by the voters.  Supervisors are elected for a six-year term and serve staggering terms so that at no time is a completely new, inexperienced Board of Supervisors elected.  Supervisors are vested with the executive and legislative powers of the Township.  They determine municipal policy, enact laws and the budget, pay bills, establish tax rates, execute contracts, appoint Township officials, etc.
