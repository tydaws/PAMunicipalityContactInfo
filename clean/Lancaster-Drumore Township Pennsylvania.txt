The SRO is not a school disciplinarian. Disciplining students is a school responsibility. The SRO’s function will be to ensure the safety of the students and staff in all of the schools in the Solanco School District. The SRO may speak to students in class regarding a variety of subjects to include, police and their role in society, criminal and vehicle laws, drug education, the criminal justice system, and more. The SRO will also investigate and take action when any crimes are reported on school property.

The Solanco School District is comprised of students from Bart, Colerain, Drumore, East Drumore, Eden, Fulton, Little Britain, and Providence Townships, along with Quarryville Borough. The School District contacted the Quarryville Borough Police in 2016 to discuss the possibility of having an Officer assigned as a School Resource Officer, or SRO. Nearly every district in the County has an SRO assigned to the schools; some have had SRO’s for almost 15 years.
