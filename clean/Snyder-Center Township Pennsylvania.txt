2023 Waste Management Trash and Recycle Schedule
PennDOT commenced the Brodhead Road Restoration Project in 2022; the PennDOT contractors will be working 24-hours per day, 6 days per week (Monday through Saturday) to complete construction by mid-June, 2023. Construction includes roadway milling and asphalt resurfacing; and improvements to the stormwater collection system beginning at the Beaver County/Allegheny County municipal boundary in Hopewell Township extending through Center Township. Brodhead Road will be widened to include three lanes in the vicinity of Center Grange Road to accommodate a new traffic signal to be installed at this location. Additionally, the traffic signal at the intersection with Community College Drive will be upgraded/replaced. Residents should be prepared for periodic traffic disruptions, one-lane roadway conditions and noise.
