PennDOT has awarded Kriger Construction, Inc. the SR 309 Signal Corridor Safety Improvement Project. Work will start on April 17, 2023, and is expected to be completed on November 15, 2023, weather permitting. During the project, delays and single lane traffic are expected between 9:00am to 3:00pm. Please plan your travels accordingly.This project will enhance safety measures along the stretch of State Route 309 between Hillside Road and the SR 309/SR 415 split. The project aims to improve intersection safety by linking the 10 signals in the corridor, updating controllers, optimizing timing, replacing mast arms, signal heads and back plates with LED signal heads, and adding new ADA ramps and line striping. During this process, temporary lane and shoulder closures may be implemented to ensure traffic safety and maintenance.
