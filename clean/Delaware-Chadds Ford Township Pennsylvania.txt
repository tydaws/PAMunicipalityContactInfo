Question/Comment 

Landowners in Pennsylvania pay three separate annual taxes on their real property: County Tax, School Tax and Township Tax. At the bottom of this page you will find contact information for the County and School District tax offices. The Township collects only the last and smallest of these three and Chadds Ford residents enjoy one of the lowest township tax rates in the region: less than 1 mil!
