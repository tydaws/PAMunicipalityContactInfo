The first European settlers came to the area in the early 1700's.  These settlers were mostly Germans, although some were descendants of French Hugenots.  They came to America primarily from the German Province of Pfalz (or Palatinate).  The Palatinates settled the area as farmers, building family farmsteads and clearing the land for agriculture. 
The earliest known inhabitants of the Township were a meek and docile tribe of Delaware Indians called the Lenni Lenape whose ancient symbol was the turtle.  It was the sub-tribe, Minsi (Wolf), of the Lenni Lenape that lived in this area.  The largest Minsi settlement in Berks County was located at present day Virginville on the Township's southern border.
