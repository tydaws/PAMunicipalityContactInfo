For many tiny, rural communities like Broad Top Township, a $137,000 grant from the federal and state governments might be a rare boon, a one-of-a-kind chance to carry out work they wouldn’t have considered otherwise.

The development began in the 1980s, when Broad Top Township officials faced a problem common throughout Pennsylvania: Chemicals from coal-laden rock had long spilled into streams, killing wildlife and draining acidic pollution into the Raystown Branch of the Juniata River.

In their spare time, the township construction crew carries out other public projects, including contract work for neighboring governments. In 2015, they hope to finish a 10-mile nature trail on the site of a railroad that is no longer used, Thomas said.

In most poor, rural areas, families living far from municipal sewer systems rely on their own septic systems. While some homeowners can secure grant money individually, local governments generally have little say over the systems.

With acid entering the watershed from scores of “stream-killer” points, locals had long labeled them “sulfur creeks,” Township Secretary David Thomas said.

In the mid-1990s in Broad Top Township, however, officials expanded the government’s reach, offering government maintenance and upgrades for any resident willing to turn their septic system over to the township. Despite early misgivings from a few residents, the program has been a huge success, with all but a handful of households now part of the township system.

“They’re paying close to $15 a month for sewer service. Where else can you do that?” Schwartz said. “Where can you live in the woods and for $15 a month you have a little septic system or on-lot system and someone else takes care of it? It’s sweet.”

Just this week, officials received word that Long’s Run – a five-mile creek once laden with acid mine drainage – had been removed from a state list of impaired waterways, Thomas said. Another is set to be removed soon, Figard said, and wildlife has returned in some areas.

Terms of Service
To maintain these sweeping public projects, Broad Top Township has formed a highly trained five-member construction crew. Where other municipal governments often bid out public projects to contractors working for profit on government wage rules, the township saves grant money by having its own workers carry out the jobs, officials said.

Broad Top Township’s work has benefited from outside help and simple luck, from the flood of grants to a mountainous layout that’s allowed gravity to replace expensive pumps. But Figard of the supervisors’ board laid out their success more simply.

But for Broad Top, a Bedford County township of fewer than 2,000 people, the county commissioners’ application for the grant is par for the course. Since the 1980s and ’90s, the mountain municipality has thrived on wise planning and the aggressive pursuit of outside money – and they’ve become a model for other communities, cleaning up their once-polluted waterways and guaranteeing cheap sewer service for every resident.

The township supervisors resolved to clean up their waterways, officials said, securing matching grants from the federal government to build limestone-lined ponds that help filter out the acidic chemicals. In the years since, they’ve carried out more cleanup work whenever money has become available.

All this success – particularly for a small, sparsely populated community with a poverty rate slightly higher than Bedford County’s overall – has earned outside interest, officials there said. In the past two years, township representatives gave talks to colleagues from across the state, teaching them how to build trails and clean mine runoff from their streams.
“We just try to use common sense,” he said.

Their work depends on state and federal grants – which township officers pursue with a vengeance, Thomas said. Of a roughly $2.5 million annual budget, about $1 million is comprised of grants, he noted, while county tallies alone show hundreds of thousands of dollars in pass-through grants during the last few years.

Meanwhile, the government matching funds that helped the township clean its streams also freed money for another decades-long project: ensuring every Broad Top Township resident has access to a publicly maintained sewage system.

“We’ve had phone calls from as far away as Oregon trying to figure out how a township with a population of about 1,800 could have sewage for every person,” Robert Figard, a supervisor for 18 years, said. “Our township’s a little bit unique.”

That funding helps municipal officials carry out a unique mission statement: That waterway cleanup and public waste disposal are just as important as maintaining roads, long the primary responsibility of tiny local governments, Thomas said.
