LWT and the Board of Supervisors rely on the PA DEP to monitor and regulate the health and safety of our streams, and any discharges into them by the landfill, or anyone else. Until more information is available from the PA DEP, as a precautionary measure the Township encourages residents along Kreutz Creek below the bridge at East Prospect Road to exercise caution in wading in the stream, and for residents to avoid eating fish from, or ingesting water from, the creek. We have been and will continue to seek feedback and guidance from the PA DEP about the creek and its safety, and whether any dangers are posed to residents.

At the May 2022 Lower Windsor Township (LWT) meeting, the Board of Supervisors were made aware that water samples collected by LWT residents and analyzed by an accredited water testing laboratory reportedly indicate the presence of toxic substances in Kreutz Creek at levels that were suggested could be considered dangerous to human health or the environment.  The Board was told that the samples were taken from portions of the stream located downstream of the discharge of water from the landfill into the creek. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) has been notified of this data by concerned citizens and has confirmed to the township that it is reviewing the information.
