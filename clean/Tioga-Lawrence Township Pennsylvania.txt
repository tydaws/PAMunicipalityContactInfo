In 1813, two townships were carved out of the Chinklacamoose area of Clearfield County in Central Pennsylvania: Lawrence and Pike. At that time, Lawrence Township also included the land that would later become Goshen, Girard, Covington, and Karthaus townships, as well as Elk County, which would later be named Cameron County. Lawrence was named for U.S. Commodore James Lawrence, who died in the War of 1812. Dan Ogden was the first person to settle permanently in Lawrence Township, arriving around 1796. Today, at almost 84 square miles and with more than 7,700 residents, Lawrence Township is one of the largest municipalities in Clearfield County.
