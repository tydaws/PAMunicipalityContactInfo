More Changes Coming to Stanbridge Street Park!
Police Department Phil Pulaski, Chief of Police
Stanbridge Street Park is the largest of these eight parks and the one that offers the most amenities. It is the host to several of our special events listed above, such as Community Day, Movie in the Park and our Summer Concert Series. It is also the home of our popular Senior Bocce league, as we maintain two bocce courts with a scoreboard, picnic area and canopied players area. These bocce courts are available for rent through the Township. Stanbridge Street Park also has two updated tennis/pickleball courts, recently renovated in 2018, a outdoor basketball court, a sand volleyball court, a lighted softball field and various playground equipment! There is a one-mile paved walking trail that loops through our beautiful grounds and connects to the very popular Norristown Farm Park trail. The latest addition to the Stanbridge Street Park is the Clubhouse at Stanbridge Street Park. This indoor facility is available for rental and can be utilized in many ways. The Township has held small recreation programs, special training events and even a Mom's group to name a few! Also available for rental is our newly updated Pavilion. This covered picnic area with numerous charcoal grills is a popular choice for graduation parties, birthday parties and even team building days!
