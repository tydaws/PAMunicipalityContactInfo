Broadband Survey
The Digital Literacy Coalition and CCIU is currently conducting a survey of our community to learn more about Broadband connectivity and any gaps or needs in our area. It is their mission to assist with technology access and literacy and they need this data to plan and fund solutions. Here is a link to the survey: http://s.alchemer.com/s3/CCIU-Broadband-Survey.  We would encourage the residents of Lower Oxford Township that do not have internet service to take this survey.
NOTE: All area Ambulance and Advanced Life Support services remain available by calling 9-1-1.
