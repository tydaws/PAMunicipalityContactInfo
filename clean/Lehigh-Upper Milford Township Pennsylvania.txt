								Upper Milford Township encompasses the villages of Powder Valley, Shimerville, Vera Cruz, Old Zionsville, and Zionsville in the southern most portion of Lehigh County. Nestled within rolling hills and scenic valleys, the Township has a rural aura with picturesque churches and barns, many vintage houses, fields for farming, and small family businesses. Expanded consumer services and shopping opportunities are readily available via the Routes 29/100 highway. Nearby areas include immediate neighbors, Emmaus and Macungie; Allentown and Bethlehem, 15-20 minutes north; and the Upper Perkiomen Valley, 15 minutes south. Philadelphia is a 45 minute drive south. Upper Milford Township was the first township organized in Lehigh County.
