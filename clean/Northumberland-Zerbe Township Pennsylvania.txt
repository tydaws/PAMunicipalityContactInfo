Northumberland County has partnered with Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), thus allowing us to use the most comprehensive, and widely known GIS software on the market. This software suite is used by every County in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in some aspect of government, and allows us to update and maintain the County’s data (ex. from Parcels to Elections) and process requests from the public faster (ex. Addressing.)

The assigning of addresses is done in many steps. First, the resident requesting the address will be required to fill out a request form and mail it back to the Addressing Coordinator. When the request is received by the Coordinator, they will use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software to assign the address. This will include the use of Aerial photography and sophisticated digital tools that measure the lengths of road segments in relationship to the surrounding property to accurately assign a standardized number to the structure. This address then gets input to many different systems. It will be added to the County Tax Assessment Database, as well as the United States Postal Service Database, and the 911 Centers GIS data used for Emergency Dispatch.

GIS is a critical part of today’s world. Although transparent to most, it is the basis for providing seamless functionality for almost everything digital. The many benefits of GIS range from saving time and money on record keeping and record management, to stream lining workflow, and allowing for expedited services that can be provided to different County agencies as well as the public.
