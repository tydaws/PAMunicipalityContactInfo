How are real estate taxes calculated?Real estate taxes are calculated by multiplying the local millage rate (property tax rate) by 1/1000th of the assessed value of the property. To calculate, take your ASSESSED value and divide by 1000, then multiply by the millage rate.

Who is responsible for paying real estate taxes?All owners listed on the deed of a property are legally responsible for paying the full amount of the real estate tax.Failure to receive a bill does not alleviate you from the responsibility.Original tax bills are mailed to the homeowner, not the mortgage company. If funds are held in escrow to pay real estate taxes, avoid duplicate or missed payments by checking with your lender to determine payment expectations. Failure to pay property taxes can result in a tax lien or foreclosure. If necessary, contact the tax collector for a copy of the tax bill.
