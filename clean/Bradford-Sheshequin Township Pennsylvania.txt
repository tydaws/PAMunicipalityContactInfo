Secretary:     Lori Kepner
post date: July 2017, end date: ongoing    With the completion of our facilities, the Board of Supervisors would like to add ambient displays to the walls of our meeting room that reflect the history and heritage of the township. To that end, the board is soliciting a project that encompasses all the aspiring aspects of our township. It is our hope that they could and will include both images of olden days and present-day treasures; the abundance of wildlife in our fields and woods, scenic vistas within the township, homesteads or farmsteads that garnish our countryside. Anything that enhances our local heritage.
