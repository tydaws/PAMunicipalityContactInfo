These other municipalities had concerns similar to Towamencin - that their systems needed millions of dollars of improvements to bring them up to current state and federal standards with possibly millions more needed to accommodate future mandates by the federal government. In order to determine whether there are better alternatives to achieve these results, and at the same time achieve financial benefits for the community, these municipalities conducted a detailed independent financial analysis.

At the Board’s January 13, 2021 meeting, PFM representatives reviewed the asset exploration process along with the approximate timeline. In Phase 1, described as a preliminary limited-scope evaluation, the system was evaluated using three evaluation methods: cost, income, and market approach. The cost approach combined the overall sewer capital assets and depreciation. The income approach assigns values based on future income estimates generated from the system, such as future rates, future treatment/capital expenses, future Township growth, inflation and sewage disposal costs. The market approach included compiling values derived from comparing financial metrics to similar transactions, such as geography, size, collection only vs. collection and treatment services.

Monetization of Assets – After an independent study (Hazen & Sawyer) of the collection and treatment systems, completed several years ago, there were initial concerns whether the existing system would be able to meet future permit limit requirements without significant capital expenditures. The question was raised whether the Township should consider “monetization” (selling) of the system as other Pennsylvania municipalities and authorities have done recently. Monetization is the process of converting assets into economic value.

On September 3, 2020, representatives of Public Financial Management (“PFM”) attended the Sewer Committee’s meeting to review the process of evaluating the sewer system and whether monetization is a worthwhile option. The Committee agreed that it is the responsible and prudent action to examine whether it is in the Township’s best interest, or not, to monetize the sanitary sewer system and recommended that an “Analysis & Valuation” study of the sanitary sewer system be conducted to collect the needed information to make an informed decision on monetization. Public Financial Management (PFM) submitted a proposal for an Analysis & Valuation study and presented background on the company and reviewed the monetizing sewer system concept and process to the Committee (and to the Board of Supervisors at their September 23rd meeting), and why municipalities consider the service.

With the completion of Phase 1, the next step was to examine whether it is advantageous to enter into a public/private or public/public asset sale of the sewer system. This process would require two additional phases. Phase 2 includes the preparation of documents, including drafting and distribution of requests for qualifications, outreach to potential investors and/or system operators to confirm market interest in the assets, establishment of a timeline for a possible transaction, and identification of key issues to be resolved. Professional hourly rates range from $150-$350 per hour, which would be deferred as part of a potential sale. Phase 3 includes coordinating the sale transaction and closing process, should that decision be made, and developing a plan to effectively deploy the proceeds from the monetization.

When dialing 9-1-1 do not hang up, even if you have misdialed the phone. Wait for the operator to reply to your call. Speak slowly and clearly. Many times callers will become loud or over-excited during an emergency. It is important for everyone concerned that you try to remain calm and provide the operator with the information he or she needs to properly take care of your call.
