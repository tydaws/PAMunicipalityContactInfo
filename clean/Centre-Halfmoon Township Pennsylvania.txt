Applications & PermitsBids / Bid ResultsBudgetsReal Estate Tax Information
Real estate property tax payments must be received in the office or postmarked by the United States Postal Service (USPS) on or before the due date to avoid further penalties. The postmark date is used to determine if the payment was mailed on or before the tax deadline. The USPS only postmarks certain mail depending on the type of postage, and they may not postmark mail the same day you mailed it. If we receive a payment without a USPS postmark, we will consider it received on the date it physically comes into our office.
