LYKENS TOWNSHIP BOARD ofÂ SUPERVISORS
 In 1961 the last one room school  closed and all children attended Upper Dauphin Schools.Â  Â As  children graduated and went off to college many did not return.Â  The family farm was in decline.Â  About 1975 an Order of Amish from Lancaster  discovered the gems of the valley and began purchasing farms.Â  At present there are again one room schools  in the area, children speaking PA German and the present has again become the  past.Â  Â

Lykens Township is rich in history  as once there was everything a Penna. German family needed for survival.Â  A grist mill, tannery, feed mill, cider  press, general store, one room schools (7) to educate his children when they  were not busy helping in the fields.Â In  the early 1900âs many families spoke only Penna. German (PA Dutch) in the  home.Â  As a result many children entered  school not speaking English.Â  This  created a hardship on the children and made school difficult.Â  The spiritual needs at that time were cared  for by Colemanâs Church (St Matthews), Klingerâs Church (Zion), and Hoffmanâs  (St. Peterâs)Â  which are all in existence  today.Â Â  These cemetaries hold a wealth  of ancestral information.
