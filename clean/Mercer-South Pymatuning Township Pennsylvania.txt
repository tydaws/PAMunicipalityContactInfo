COVID-19 in PennsylvaniaThe expiration of the federal Public Health Emergency (PHE) declaration does not mean the virus is gone. The best defense against COVID-19 remains getting vaccinated and continuing basic health and hygiene practices, like handwashing, staying home when sick and avoiding contact with people who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19. The CDC will continue to keep track of variants; you can find the latest information here.After May 11, 2023, when the PHE expired, much of the COVID-19 data states have been collecting will no longer be mandated to be reportable to the Department of Health, therefore data shared on this site going forward will not be as comprehensive as it was since the start of the pandemic Everyone over the age of 6 months is encouraged get vaccinated.
