Douglass Township is located on the western border of Montgomery County about 30 miles west from Philadelphia. Our community is mixed with residential neighborhoods, businesses and many acres of rural rolling hills and farmlands. Founded in 1741, our municipality still has one of the smallest population densities in Montgomery County, with just 10,000 residents across 15.4 square miles.
