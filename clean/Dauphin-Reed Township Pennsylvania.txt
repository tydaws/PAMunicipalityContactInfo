Projects
The Upper Dauphin Council of Governments is comprised of elected officials of municipalities in Upper Dauphin County* that wish to participate on a yearly basis. The elected officials that are appointed to the Council of Governments (COG) Committee by each of their respective municipality are the voting members. Each year, the COG Committee appoints a President, Vice President and Secretary-Treasurer. The COG is an excellent means for the exchange of ideas and to provide for the effective communication and coordination among area municipalities. The COG can also help to improve the efficiency of local governments by providing general and technical information to member municipalities, as well as promoting legislation which is beneficial to our area.
