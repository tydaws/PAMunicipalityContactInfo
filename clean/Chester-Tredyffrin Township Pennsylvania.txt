The use of single plastic bags has severe environmental impacts, including entering local waterways, littering the environment and causing harm to wildlife, becoming stuck in or upon natural resources and public property, and blocking storm drains. Shopping with reusable, compostable or recyclable paper bags can help reduce waste and litter and keep our Township streets and waterways clean.
