Home owners with public sewer and public water may want to consider switching to a deduct meter.

Capital Fundraising Campaign Info
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed a proposed cleanup plan for the Chem Fab Superfund Site. The Proposed Plan addresses soil gas, soil, sediment, and surface water contamination that were impacted by the Site. Based on the available information, EPA’s preferred cleanup alternative is a combination of SG - 3, Soil - 4, and SD - 3. These cleanup alternatives are identified on page 19 of the Proposed Plan document. The Preferred Alternative includes vapor intrusion mitigation and monitoring, and institutional controls to address soil gas (vapors originating from contaminated soil); excavation and off-site disposal to address soil; and excavation, stabilization, and off-site disposal and institutional controls to address sediment.
