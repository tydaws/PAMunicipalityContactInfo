There is a large body of literature available to aid in the selection, installation and maintenance of trees. The Township has created the South Whitehall Township Shade Tree Ordinances, Policy and Guide to help residents understand Township regulations with regard to trees, as well as offer useful information regarding the selection, installation and maintenance of trees. The Township has created a number of smaller, more specific guides for residents to use a well. You can find them in the documents folder the left hand side of this page.

Police officers do not dispatch nuisance animals, only those that are visibly sick or injured. Please contact an animal control company for assistance.
When dealing with the Township, trees are divided into several categories, each of which has its own associated regulations. “Shade Trees” or “Street Trees” refers to trees within the rights-of-way of public streets. These trees are most commonly known as the trees between the curb and the sidewalk along many public streets. Since the right-of-way of any given public street will generally extend beyond the edge of the roadway, it may not be easy to determine, in areas without sidewalks, if a given tree is a “Shade Tree.” Please call the Township if you have a question regarding the location of the right-of-way of a public street. “Parking Lot Trees” refers to those trees in and surrounding commercial parking lots as required by the Zoning Ordinance. “Buffer Strips” refers to trees and vegetation that serve as an attractive sound and light barrier around commercial uses as required by the Zoning Ordinance. Generally speaking, all other trees on private property are considered private property and may only be subject to Township concern should a situation arise regarding visibility along (or access to) a public right-of-way, danger to property, or public safety.

The estimated time frame is 6 to 9 months after authorization. The Township has no control on when the installation will occur after authorization. A petition is not required for streetlight installation in subdivisions under construction as authorization was pre-approved in the subdivision plan approval process. Usually, streetlights are installed in developing subdivisions when 50% of the houses are built on a given street.

PPL will install a streetlight only if the Township authorizes them to do so as the Township will incur the cost. Therefore, a completed Streetlight Petition Application must be submitted to the Township Board of Commissioners for their consideration. The applicant may attend the Board meeting to discuss the matter. If the Board finds the request plausible, the Township will authorize PPL to install the fixture.

You may contact the Police department to advise us your animal is missing and to check if it was found. (Please recontact us if you locate your animal.) Stray dogs will be held at the Township kennels until they can be transported to the Sanctuary at Haafsville, 901 Nestle Way, Breinigsville, PA 18031 or the owner is located. Per South Whitehall Township Ordinance, there is a penalty assessed in the amount of $50; additionally, the owner is responsible for paying all reasonable expenses that the Township incurs for keeping the animal (including a charge for daily board) prior to release of the dog.  This applies to both licensed and unlicensed dogs.
You may also contact the Sanctuary at Haafsville at 484-788-8062 to check if your animal has been turned in to them.
