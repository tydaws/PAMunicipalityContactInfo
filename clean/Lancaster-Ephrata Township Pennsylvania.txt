According to a study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, unsecured loads and debris in the road led to 200,000 crashes between 2011-2014.  During that time, debris related vehicle accidents caused 39,000 injuries and 500 deaths.  Data released by the same organization found that as a nation, we spend $11.5 billion combating litter, 40% of which comes from unsecured loads.

LCSWMA - TARP POLICY
Loads must be covered with a securely fastened water-resistant cover that eliminates potential for littering and other nuisances.25 Pa. Code §§ 285.211(a) and 299.211(a) 
Agendas/Minutes
“The health and safety of our community matters,” Robert Zorbaugh, Chief Executive Officer of LCSWMA, said.  “Waste coming loose from unsecured loads is dangerous to drivers and litters our roadways.  Our employees spend countless hours collecting litter from trailers, pick-up trucks and commercial vehicles that aren’t properly tarped.  The objective of the $20 penalty is to change behavior so customers abide by the existing policy,” he added.
