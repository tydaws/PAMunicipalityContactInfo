MS4 Information
Perkiomen Township was established in 1886 after a court appointed commission split Skippack Township and Perkiomen Township along the Perkiomen Creek. At that time the township was classified as a township of the second-class. Under that classification, a Board of Supervisors was established as the governing body. This body can be made up of either three or five members. In Perkiomen Township’s case the board is made up of five members.
