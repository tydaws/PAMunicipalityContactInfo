Tuscarora Township
Welcome to
717-734-2280 
Tuscarora Township was settled in 1754 after the treaty at Albany, New York. The Township was erected by the court at Lewistown as a part of Mifflin County by dividing Lack Township. The Township was proposed at the April session of the court and confirmed at the August term of the court in 1825 and the new Township was called Tuscarora. The name was taken from the Tuscarora Creek that flows through the Township and the Tuscarora Mountain that forms tone of the Township borders. The assessment taken in 1826 showed 150 taxable residents and 42 single freemen residing in the Township.
