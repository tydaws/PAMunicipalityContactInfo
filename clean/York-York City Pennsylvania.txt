York City staff, not the hauler, perform curbside collections of Christmas Trees generally during the first two weeks of January.  These trees are chipped for mulch.
In York City, there are two refuse districts.  With some exceptions, roughly the City is divided in half along Market Street to form the two refuse districts.
The Comprehensive Plan translates community values and vision into policies and regulations that direct the quality of growth, intensity and diversity of land use, transportation modes, street planning, public facilities and services, parks and recreation, and resource lands and critical areas.

Add cat litter to liquid paint/product to absorb most of the moisture.  Then, securely seal all containers before placing them, in small quantities, in securely tied trash bags with normal trash.  Do not place open containers of liquid separately for collection and do not place loose in trash cans with no tied trash bag.  To avoid any mess, it is also recommended to surround the cans with crumbled newspapers inside the bags of trash because everything is compacted in the collection vehicles.
Do not place any recyclable items in plastic bags.
