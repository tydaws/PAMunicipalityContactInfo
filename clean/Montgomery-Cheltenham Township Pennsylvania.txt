Resiliency, flood mitigation and water quality projects will continue to place a strain on the Township’s budgets and will likely require tax increases. The Township is investigating a stormwater impact fee as an equitable option for financing these costs.

For properties or structures that have been elevated, a Letter of Map Revision (based on fill) LOMR-F, is used, and this verifies that an existing structure or parcel of land that was elevated by fill, would not be inundated by the 1% chance flood. The link for this form is also http://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/31858.  This too is submitted to FEMA in conjunction with an elevation certificate.

HOW:
Managing the Township’s municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) – the system of pipes, drains, ditches, and other conveyances that carry stormwater into the waters of the U.S. – also carries significant costs to maintain and meet the requirements of the Clean Water Act, a necessity for federal permission to release stormwater into federal waters. The Township’s stormwater capital and operating costs will only increase as regulations become more stringent.

Stormwater impact fees are being implemented in communities across the country to help finance projects that will meet increasing state and federal regulations placed upon communities to manage stormwater and improve water quality. In addition, the fees collected enable municipalities to take on stormwater projects that will improve their ability to anticipate, prepare for, and respond to hazardous events related to climate, otherwise known as climate resiliency.

FEMA uses the most accurate flood hazard information available and applies rigorous standards in developing the FIRMs. However, because of limitations of scale or topographic definition of the source maps used to prepare FIRMs, sometimes a property’s existing structures lie out of the floodplain while portions of the property lie in the floodplain.  Recognizing that these situations do occur, FEMA has established an administrative process or procedure that enables a change in the designation of a property on the FIRM. Through these processes, an individual who owns, rents, or leases property may submit certain mapping and survey information to FEMA and request that FEMA issue a document known as a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), accessible at the following link http://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/31858, which is an official amendment to an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), typically issued to remove a property and/or structure from a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). In most cases, the applicant will need to hire a Licensed Land Surveyor or Registered Professional Engineer to prepare an Elevation Certificate for the property.

As part of this process, in 2014, Cheltenham Township amended and adopted a Floodplain Conservation District Ordinance, accessible in the  Township municipal code, which incorporated certain minimum requirements that are essential in order for the community to participate in the NFIP. This Ordinance is part of Article XXI of Chapter 295 of the Zoning Ordinance, section 153 through 162.25. As part of the Letter of Final Map Determination, the Township made minor changes to its Ordinance, to be consistent with the FIRMs that went into effect on March 2, 2016.

Cheltenham will be joining the growing number of communities in Pennsylvania investigating a stormwater impact fee. Approximately 40 communities across Pennsylvania have stormwater impact fees, including Philadelphia, Radnor Township, and West Chester Borough. Municipalities with stormwater impact fees also receive more grant or financing opportunities to further offset the costs of stormwater management projects.Stormwater Matters: Financing Our Future Public Meeting No. 1 Recap

Township Facilities
The stormwater impact fee will be assessed based on a property’s use of the Township’s stormwater system. Properties with more building, parking lot, and other impervious coverage will be charged more, as they typically generate more stormwater than smaller properties. Often, properties with significant amounts of impervious coverage, such as schools and religious institutions, are those that pay little to no property taxes. They would, however, be required to pay a stormwater impact fee.

Report a Concern
Cheltenham is highly susceptible to flood events and is working with agencies such as the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) on several flood mitigation projects. Even with significant funding contributed by the USACE and DEP, the Township will contribute substantial capital and operating dollars to these and other flood mitigation projects.

Upon receiving a complete application forms package, FEMA will normally complete its review and issue its determination in 4 to 6 weeks. The Elevation Certificate can also be procured from your insurance agent as it is generally required for all NFIP participants. This would only be applicable if your property has always been a part of the program.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) released new Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) that went into effect on March 2, 2016. These are official maps of the community, on which the Administrator has delineated both the special hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to our community, including a graphical representation of Special Flood Hazard Areas, flood hazard risk zones, 0.2% chance floodplain areas, and other flood related information. No significant changes have been made to the flood hazard data on the preliminary and/or revised preliminary copies of the FIRM for Montgomery County. Anyone in Cheltenham Township with a mortgage from a federally-regulated lender, whose property in any way encroaches a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), is required to carry flood insurance. Flood insurance is available through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is a federally underwritten program, provided by insurance companies through licensed insurance agents.
