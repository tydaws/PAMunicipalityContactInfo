 Lower Heidelberg Township has had a long and illustrious history. When driving our roadways, one encounters modern houses and businesses, then rolling fields of corn, rye, and wheat. In the south, Hains Church stands high atop a hill overlooking Wernersville in the Lebanon Valley and beyond to Cushion Peak in the South Mountains. In the north, Brownsville Road hugs the ridge affording panoramic vistas of Blue Marsh Lake and the majestic Blue Mountains in the distance. In between, old stone farmhouses, wooden barns, and deserted homesteads nestled in the hills stand as reminders of a by-gone era.

The MS4 Program – When stormwater runoff enters municipal owned storm drains and that portion of the municipality has been deemed an “urbanized area” (urbanized areas are determined by Census Data), the municipality is required to develop and implement a stormwater management program and apply for various permits to reduce the contamination of stormwater runoff similar to businesses that release water as a byproduct of their operations. The Municipal Separate Storm Sewer (MS4) Permit requires municipalities to monitor stormwater, educate targeted audiences about water pollution, and enact and enforce stormwater ordinances, along with various other stormwater prevention and protection activities.
