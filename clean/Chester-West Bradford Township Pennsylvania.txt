The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has sold the Embreeville property.  For many years Embreeville was home to a State-owned psychiatric hospital.  The property was then utilized for various educational and institutional uses until the buildings were vacated in 2010. The property now includes many athletic fields used by West Bradford Youth Athletics (WBYA).Embreeville Updates2-28-23: Embreeville Preliminary Plan.1-04-22:  Demolition has been completed and restoration work is currently taking place.  Due to winter temperatures, which will delay seed germination and stabilization, we anticipate final completion and closing to take place in the second quarter of 2022.1-14-21:  Remediation is completed and demolition is underway.  We are optimistic that cleanup and restoration will be completed near the end of 2021.2-10-20: The Chester County Court of Common Pleas has signed the order approving the Embreeville Settlement Agreement. The settlement is now officially completed. Remediation efforts are underway on the property. Those efforts are being monitored closely by the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).OCTOBER 24, 2019:   EMBREEVILLE PRESS RELEASEOCTOBER 23, 2019:  Please note that the scheduled November 6, 2019 Continued Hearing on Embreeville (Appeal #428) has been cancelled and THE appeal has been withdrawn. Oct. 22 - Board of Supervisors Special Embreeville Meeting @ West Bradford Elementary School - 7pm.    The Board voted in favor of the proposed Settlement Agreement with Embreeville Redevelopment.    The entirety of the Embreeville documents remain subject to further negotiation and finalization by both the Township and the developer.NOTICE IS GIVEN that the Board of Supervisors of West Bradford Township will conduct a special public meeting on Tuesday, October 22, 2019, at 7:00 p.m. at the West Bradford Elementary School, 1475 Broad Run Rd, Downingtown, PA 19335, to consider and possibly approve a Settlement Agreement with Embreeville Redevelopment L.P. (“Developer”).  Developer is the owner of real property located at 1818 West Strasburg Road, located between West Strasburg Road to the north and Telegraph Road to the south, known as Chester County Tax Parcel No. 50-8-9, containing approximately 200 acres.  Developer is also the equitable owner of real property located at 1750 West Strasburg Road and Shagbark Drive, being Chester County Tax Parcel No. 50-8-9.4 (the “SPCA Parcel”).  The proposed Settlement Agreement would settle a pending lawsuit filed by Developer which challenged the validity of the West Bradford Township Zoning Ordinance on grounds that it was substantively invalid by not providing a “fair share” of multifamily housing in the Township. Developer filed an appeal from the West Bradford Township Zoning Hearing Board’s decision which dismissed Developer’s substantive validity challenge.  That appeal is pending before the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County. The Settlement Agreement would also settle a second pending application that Developer filed with the West Bradford Township Zoning Hearing Board requesting a validity variance in order to use the Property and the SPCA Parcel for multifamily development.  The Board will consider and possibly approve the Settlement Agreement to resolve the outstanding appeal and application and authorize the Township to purchase the Property, less approximately 5 acres with existing buildings located thereon, for a purchase price of $22.5 Million Dollars.  The Settlement Agreement would require Developer to demolish all buildings on the portion of the Property proposed to be acquired by the Township, properly abate the asbestos in such buildings and obtain Act 2 environmental clearance from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.  It would allow Developer to develop the SPCA Parcel with no more than 33 single-family detached dwellings based on a land development plan to be filed and reviewed by the Board.   A draft of the Settlement Agreement is available for public inspection and may be examined without charge or obtained for a charge not greater than the costs thereof at the Township’s municipal building located at 1385 Campus Drive during normal business hours Monday through Friday 7:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and is also available on the Township’s website, www.westbradford.org.  If any person who wishes to attend the meeting has a disability and/or requires an auxiliary aid, service or other accommodation to observe or participate in the meeting, he or she should contact the Township Building at (610) 269-4174 to discuss how those needs may be accommodated.  Township ManagerEmbreeville Redevelopment LP – Status Report - October 16, 2019 Meeting:   The Board of Supervisors conducted a special meeting on Wednesday, October 16, 2019 to discuss with the public a proposed settlement agreement with Embreeville Redevelopment LP, (“Developer”) the owner of the 200 acre parcel of property located at 1818 West Strasburg Road. Developer is also the equitable owner of the property located at 1750 West Strasburg Road and Shagbark Drive, referred to as the SPCA Parcel. The proposed Settlement Agreement would settle a pending lawsuit filed by Developer which challenged the validity of the West Bradford Township Zoning Ordinance on grounds that it was substantively invalid by not providing a “fair share” of multifamily housing in the Township. Developer filed an appeal from the West Bradford Township Zoning Hearing Board’s decision which dismissed Developer’s substantive validity challenge. That appeal is pending before the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County. The Settlement Agreement would also settle a second pending application that Developer filed with the West Bradford Township Zoning Hearing Board requesting a validity variance in order to use the Property and the SPCA Parcel for multifamily development.Over the past several weeks, the Board has been negotiating with the Developer in order to settle the outstanding appeal and application and allow the Township to purchase the 200 acre property, less approximately 5 acres with existing buildings located thereon, for a purchase price of $22.5 Million Dollars. The purchase price is based on an appraisal of the property that the Township commissioned. The Settlement Agreement would require Developer to demolish all buildings on the portion of the property proposed to be acquired by the Township, properly abate the asbestos in such buildings and obtain Act 2 environmental clearance from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. It would allow Developer to develop the SPCA Parcel with no more than 33 single-family detached dwellings based on a land development plan to be filed and subsequently reviewed by the Board.In order to fund the purchase price of the property, the Board proposes to enact a real estate tax of one mill pursuant to the authority in the Local Tax Enabling Act. The board would also obtain bond financing and use revenue generated from the Township's open space tax for to pay for a portion of the property.The parties are continuing to negotiate the final terms of the Settlement Agreement. As soon as that draft is completed, a copy will be made available on the Township's website. The Board intends - if all outstanding settlement matters are resolved - to conduct a special meeting on Tuesday, October 22, 2019 at 7:00 p.m. at the West Bradford Elementary School where the final terms of the settlement agreement and purchase of the property will be discussed and potentially approved by the Board. - UPDATES WILL BE SHARED AS DEVELOPMENTS OCCUR. Thank you!Please note that the scheduled November 6, 2019 Continued Hearing on Embreeville (Appeal #428) has been cancelled and the appeal has been withdrawn. NOTICE: West Bradford Zoning Hearing Board will consider the following continued application and all other matters that properly come before it at 7PM on November 6, 2019 (CANCELLED) at the Township Building, 1385 Campus Dr., Downingtown.  CONTINUED APPEAL #428.  Applicant: Embreeville Redevelopment, L.P.  Application concerns property being UPI No. 50-8-9, consisting of 206+/- acres at 1818 West Strasburg Road, West Bradford Township.  Applicant seeks a  “use variance” and/or a “validity variance” from the IM Institutional/Mixed Use District Zoning Regulations at Zoning Ordinance Section 450-58, to permit redevelopment of the former Embreeville Center for uses which differ from those allowed under the Zoning Ordinance,  and which yield a combination of single-family attached, single-family semi-detached, 2-family detached,  and multiple family dwellings (including garden apartments) and “other similar uses”,  of a number “adequate to allow the reasonable development of the property.”   A variance for such uses is requested together with bulk and area variances as to lot area, lot width, maximum impervious surface area, maximum building height, and front, side and rear yard setbacks.  Copies of the applications are available for public inspection at the Township Building, M-F, 7AM - 4:30PM.
