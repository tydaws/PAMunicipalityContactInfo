White Deer Township is governed by a board of three supervisors elected at large by the voters for a six-year term.  The board serves as the township's legislative body, setting policy, enacting local ordinances, adopting budgets, and levying taxes. Because there is no separately elected executive the board also performs the executive functions, such as enforcing ordinances, approving expenditures, and hiring employees. 
The township supervisors generally meet on the fourth Tuesday each month at 7:00pm at the township building at 2191 Creek Road, New Columbia.  Click the calendar tab to view all official meeting dates and times.
