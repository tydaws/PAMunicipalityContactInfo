Permit Information 
Don Robinson - Zoning & Codes Enforcement Officer - 570-435-0919 Rom Andraka - Building Codes Inspector - 570-995-1729
Zoning and Building permits are required in Hepburn Township. Permits are required for most work that is completed within the township.
There is a two part process for receiving your Zoning and Building permits. First, you must obtain a Zoning permit from the Zoning Officer. This permit is issued once the zoning district regulations have been reviewed and allow for the proposed work, the setback requirements are met, and all local, county, state, federal, and floodplain regulations are met. A fee applies for the zoning permit payable to Hepburn Township.
Once you have completed the zoning permit process, you will be directed to the Building Codes Official. The Building Codes Official will not issue a permit or do any inspections of any work until he receives a copy of the zoning permit issued from the Township Zoning Officer. The Building Codes Official will require plans to be reviewed by him before issuing a permit and will inform you of what inspections will be needed for your project. The Building Codes Official is a third party inspector and payment will be payable to him.
Projects needing a Zoning and Building Permit are:

New homes
Additions
Garages
Pools
Porches and Decks
Accessory Structures including Sheds

Zoning Permits (and possible state permits) are needed for:

All businesses
Home Occupations
Junk Yards
Logging
Major Excavations
Driveways Onto Township and State Roads
All Signs

Basic items which do not require a permit:

Replacing roof shingles (if replacing trusses or rafter framing, permit IS required)
Replacing siding
Painting
