Stormwater Management Information
County-wide Act 167 Plan Contents
The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection approved the “County-wide Act 167 Stormwater Management Plan for Chester County, PA” on July 2, 2013 (as submitted). The State, through Act 167, requires that all Chester County municipalities adopt the ordinance requirements included in the Plan.
Stormwater Management
Management of stormwater is necessary to compensate for the possible impacts of development such as flooding, erosion and sedimentation problems, concentration on flow on adjacent properties, damages to roads, bridges and other infrastructure as well as non-point source pollution washed off from impervious surfaces.
New London Township is required to obtain a permit under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) in order to operate a storm sewer system. The permit, called a Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permit, requires the Township to take certain steps to ensure that stormwater in the Township is properly managed and controlled.  The permit also requires that the Township educate the public about storm water impacts, as well as provide opportunities for public involvement and participation. To read more about the MS4 program, permits and impacts click on the link below:
https://www.epa.gov/npdes
Stormwater.
Stormwater is water that originates during rain events and snow/ice melt. It can soak into the soil or stay on the surface and evaporate.   Stormwater can runoff and end up in nearby streams, rivers, or other water bodies.   This runoff, and the pollution it picks up as it flows, is the main contributor to water quality pollution in Chester County.
Stormwater Run Off.
Stormwater is any precipitation that flows over the ground that flows into a nearby river or stream.
Too much rain, not absorbed into the ground, becomes stormwater runoff. This can cause flooding. Stormwater runoff is also one of the major causes of water pollution in Chester County. Pollutants such as soil and automotive fluid are carried off in the runoff. This polluted runoff is not treated and flows to the nearest stream. Improving the management of stormwater runoff can be accomplished by finding ways to increase the amount of rainwater that can be absorbed into the ground (at home, your business and in your community) and by preventing pollutants from entering the water.      
Stormwater runs off roof tops, driveways, parking lots, roadways, sidewalks, yards, etc.  Sometimes it flows directly into streams.  In developed areas, this runoff drains to streets, then enters storm drains, flows through stormwater sewer pipes, and eventually discharges to streams.   All particles such as trash, cigarette butts, pet waste, lawn chemicals, de-icing salts and chemicals, vehicle fluid droppings, and everything else that accumulates on the pavements and land surfaces are carried by the stormwater into the streams.
Stormwater while running over pavement and parking lots can pick up pollutants before flowing into a nearby river or stream.  The precipitation of Impervious surfaces such as roads, parking lots, and roofs can not soak into the ground through these surfaces.  Impervious surfaces also increase the amount and speed water entering rivers and other water bodies which can increase the severity and frequency of floods, destruction of fish and other water dependent species habitats.  Anything that enters a storm

Chester County’s Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program
Only Rain in the Drain!
Chester County Government is committed to protecting and improving water quality in our streams.
All County lands and buildings drain to streams that eventually drain to either the Delaware Bay or Chesapeake Bay. Clean streams are vital to our local communities, natural resources and economy, and will help restore both Bays. Stormwater runoff and its pollution are widespread water quality problems, and have degraded over 55% of the streams within Chester County. Chester County’s Stormwater Pollution Prevention Program has been designed to Improve and protect the water quality of streams, lakes and waterways that receive runoff from County properties by reducing stormwater runoff volume and pollution that is created on, and discharged from, Chester County lands and facilities.
Manage Stormwater & Flooding Citizen Benefit – Managing stormwater reduces the impacts of runoff and flooding, avoiding or lessening damage to infrastructure, harm to the environment and threat to public safety.

You Can Protect Our Local Streams
Here are a few simple things that, collectively, can make a big difference in keeping our natural waterways and water supply sources clean, safe and healthy:
Nothing but rain in the drain! Never pour or throw trash, liquids or any substance into a storm drain. These drains are directly connected to the local stream! And it’s against the law!!
Cigarette butts, coffee/ drink cups & lids, snack wrappers, plastic drink bottles – don’t drop these on the ground or in parking lots! Put them in a recycle bin or trash receptacle. None of these evaporate; all wash to the streams. Keep a small bag in your car for trash and dispose of it when you get to a recycle or trash can.
Report Illegal Dumping! – Spilling, disposing or discharging of any substance into a storm drain is illegal. Call the County at 610-344-6220 if you witness something being poured, dumped, disposed or discharged into or in the immediate vicinity of a storm drain on any County property.
Some additional things you can do at home and in your neighborhood to help reduce pollution and protect streams and waterways:


Fix car fluid leaks – repairing leaks and drops from your car’s fluids helps avoid vehicle chemicals from collecting on parking lots and being washed into storm drains, then into streams during rain events. A bit of prevention can help save several fish in the streams.


Pick up pet waste – pet droppings contain bacteria and parasites as well as nutrients, all of which create water quality problems. Every time it rains, pet waste left to decay can be washed into streams and storm drains. Even when it is not raining, these droppings are unsafe and unhealthy to be left in areas where children play such as parkland and along County trails. Carry disposable bags and pick up your pet’s waste when out on walks or in your yard. Bag it, seal it and deposit it in a trash can or waste receptacle.


Automobile Care – Wash your vehicles at a commercial facility. Here wash water is treated and must be directed to the sanitary sewer that goes to the local wastewater treatment plant, or captured for proper disposal.
Consider washing your car on a porous surface such as grass, so the wash water can soak into the soil, be treated by soil particles and microbes, and be filtered before it enters the groundwater.


Avoid Using Salt for De-icing – Salt from de-icing is rapidly becoming a widespread water pollution problem. It dissolves and is carried into streams, storm drains and infiltrates into groundwater.  Consider using non-salt de-icing chemicals. Sand and bird seed are used in place of chemical de-icers. Experiment with what works for you.  If salt is essential, store it AWAY FROM storm drains. Cover it to avoid rain from washing the salt into storm drains and streams.


Put trash in its place! Whether at the library, a County office building, a park or a trail, place all trash and waste in trash receptacles. Trash that accumulates in public areas can make it look uncared for and unsafe. It will be carried by stormwater through storm drains and into local creeks and streams.
