We are centrally located on the northern  border of Bradford County with a population of 5,000. Officially  formed in 1797, the Township surrounds the area known as the "Valley" which  includes: Athens, Sayre, and South Waverly Boroughs. The  north border is defined by the New York Pennsylvania state line. The Chemung and Susquehanna Rivers serve as the borders to the Boroughs  inside the Township. A major thoroughfare for the Township is US Route 220,  which runs north and south near the center of the township. Easy access from New York's Interstate 86/RT 17 is provided by (2)  interchanges.


The Township features recreation parks and rivers, access to a major  medical center, and great local shopping provided by wonderful local shops and large  chain stores.  We are minutes away from  (2) airports providing access to all major cities in the northeast. The township is served by the Athens Area School District.


The Township continues to  possess many of the rural traits and traditions that helped to shape this  community. Like much of rural Pennsylvania it is a beautiful, serene, safe, and vibrant  community in which to raise a family.


Our hope is this web site provides a continuing flow of meaningful  information to our residents and encourages increased communication between the  Township and the public that we serve.
