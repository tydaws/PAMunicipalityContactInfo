EDGMONT TOWNSHIP COVID-19 Response:

July 13, 2021 UPDATE: The Township is now running back on its normal operations in alignment with the lifting of the mask mandate and the state’s emergency declaration. It is now optional to wear a mask in the Township office. All Township facilities are open and operating on a normal basis/schedule. 

February 8, 2022: Due to the decline in COVID-19 cases, the Township has lifted the required mask mandate at the Township Building for vaccinated persons, making them optional for those who are vaccinated. Please be advised that those who are not vaccinated are still required to wear a mask.  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the office. 
 
January 3, 2022: You are now required to wear a mask inside the Township Building regardless of vaccination status. Masks are required at all times while inside the building. For more information on the latest CDC Covid-19 guidance, please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html 
 
How to Wear:

Wear a mask correctly and consistently for the best protection.


Have two or more layers of washable, breathable fabric
Completely cover your nose and mouth
Fit snugly against the sides of your face and don’t have gaps
Have a nose wire to prevent air from leaking out of the top of the mask
