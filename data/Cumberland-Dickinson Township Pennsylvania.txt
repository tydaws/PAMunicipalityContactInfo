WELCOME TO
DICKINSON TOWNSHIP

 
 
NOTICE: The Dickinson Township Board of Supervisors have opened a survey through “Survey Monkey” to allow input from Township residents on how they would like to receive the Township Newsletter, and how residents would like to be notified of news and announcements.
Residents are encouraged to go to the following link to take the three-question survey by no later than June 30, 2023.
https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LV7DPMX

The Township Supervisors understand that residents are frustrated with the ongoing issues with Waste Management (WM) and missed trash and recycling. Please note that the Township Staff have taken steps with WM  to help improve the situation and that Townships across the County are having the same concerns and issues with their trash companies. The Board and Staff are working hard with our local WM Representatives to hold them accountable.
Residents that are having trouble with missed trash and recycling pickup, please contact Waste Management directly and request a ticket be created for the missed pick up. Follow the steps below to assist in having your concerns addressed:

Call WM and request a ticket be created —1-800-634-4595
Provide your full address
Let them know this is for Dickinson Township  (not Gardners or Carlisle or etc.)
Request a credit be logged and given for the missed pickup.


The DTWP Park and Recreation Board is seeking one volunteer to serve on their Board.  Please contact the Township Office at (717) 486-7424 if you are interested in serving.
