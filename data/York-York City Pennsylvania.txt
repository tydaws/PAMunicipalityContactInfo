FAQs on Wastewater System
The City of York is facing an unsustainable financial situation, which will require significant tax and fee increases and painful cuts to essential services to balance the budget and pay the City’s bills. To save the City from this “doomsday” budget scenario, Mayor Michael Helfrich has proposed selling the City’s most valuable financial asset.

Home  Resident  Trash Information 





Trash Information





Household trash must be placed in securely tied trash bags or inside plastic or metal trash cans with lid and handles (preferably with trash contained in a tied bag inside each container).  Containers and bags must be those sold specifically for the purpose of trash storage (Maximum can & bag size: 32 gallons and not more than 40 pounds when filled).  Oversized and “contractor” trash bags, large totes/cans, store/grocery bags, cardboard boxes, baskets, storage containers and like containers should NOT be used for household trash.
Containers with attached lids, metal/plastic drums and other similar non-authorized containers, some with homemade handles cut into the sides, pose a risk of hand and back injuries to refuse collectors. Therefore, oversized and miscellaneous containers that are not sold specifically for trash storage, may be disposed of as illegally placed trash and no refunds will be given per the City’s Ordinance, Article 951.
For missed collection of trash, recycling, yard waste, or scheduled large-items, call either the Large-Item Service at the following phone numbers: 717-843-1240 (Mon-Thurs 9:00 a.m. – 3:30 p.m.) or call Public Works at 717-849-2245 during regular business hours.  A voice message may be left after hours and staff will respond on the next business day.
Billing
The Refuse fee is included on sewer bills each month. The Residential refuse charge is based on the number of dwelling units at a property and the Commercial refuse charge is assessed level of service needed (based on 6-bag increments per level).  The refuse fee covers costs related to curbside collections of trash, recycling, yard waste and scheduled large items as well as the related disposal costs. Revenue generated from the refuse charge also helps to cover cost associated with disposal of street sweeping grit, illegal dumping, on-street trash receptacles throughout the city as well as other related costs.

For information or questions concerning your sewer and refuse invoice, please call the Sewer Rental Office at 717-849-2268.
One residential unit is currently charged $27.35 per month.  (Limit 6 bags/cans x 2 collections each week)
One commercial unit is charged $54.70 per month.  (Limit 6 bags/cans x 2 collections each week)
The minimum administrative fee for refuse is $8.75 per month.  This fee is applied to approved commercial accounts that have private subscription trash and recycling collection services. The administrative fee helps to cover cost associated with disposal of street sweeping grit, illegal dumping, on-street trash receptacles throughout the city as well as other related costs.
To find out what the curbside collection days are for your property, call 717-843-1240 (Monday-Thursday, 9:00 a.m. – 3:30 p.m.)

Curbside Collections Hauler
Republic Services is the City’s current contracted hauler for curbside collections.  They began collecting May 1, 2013 and the current contract continues through April 30, 2021.

Place flattened cardboard boxes in container or bundle (with twine) and set beside or on top of the recycling container.
Rinse and place all designated (plastic, glass and metal) bottles, jars and cans together in the recycling container.
Place heavier items on top of lighter items to prevent them from blowing out of the recycling container.
Do not place any recyclable items in plastic bags.
Replacement recycling containers are available to curbside customers for $3.00/limit 1, with proof of residency.  Containers are available at the Public Works office, at 101 South George Street, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
Accepted forms of payment are cash (small bills) or check only.  Credit or debit cards are not accepted.
Example proof of customer status or residency includes a driver’s license or a current utility bill.



Schedule Large-Items (Household furniture/appliance items)

Household furniture and appliance items that do not fit into the weight and size limits for regular trash must be scheduled for “Large-Item” collection. York City curbside collections customers may schedule up to (5) five household furniture, appliances and other approved bulky items each week, as needed. Large-item collections are year-round as part of the regular curbside service and there is no additional fee to schedule a large-item collection. However, all items must be scheduled in advance.
Note, not all items can be scheduled for collection. There are some excluded items that must be handled privately by customers.  A few of the items that must be handled privately are pianos, organs, pool tables, car parts/seats, lumber, rocks/stones/brick/block/dirt, bags or boxes or anything, and prohibited electronics (tvs, computers and anything that plugs into a computer).
Large-item Service (scheduling 8-12 days in advance)
Phone: 717-843-1240
Monday – Thursday
9:00 a.m. – 3:30 p.m.
To receive collection next week, call before 3 p.m. this Wednesday afternoon which is when the next week’s schedule is closed out.
Do not place scheduled items out for collection until after 5 p.m. the evening prior to the scheduled date.  Items must be at the designated pick-up point by 6 a.m. on the day of scheduled collection.
NO TVs, Computers or items that plug into computer (i.e. monitor, keyboard, mouse, modem, etc)  A PA law went into effect 1/24/13 which bans these items from collection/disposal.  Customers must deliver them to an Electronic (E-Cycle) Program.
We are fortunate to have a nearby Electronic Recycling Program which is provided by  the York County Solid Waste Authority.  This is available to York County RESIDENTS only (not for commercial).
York County residents may deliver electronics to the Authority’s FREE E-Cycle program every Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. – 4:00 p.m. and Saturdays, 8:00 a.m. – 12:00 noon.
For directions and more information, contact YCSWA
P: 717-845-1066

Christmas Tree Collection

York City staff, not the hauler, perform curbside collections of Christmas Trees generally during the first two weeks of January.  These trees are chipped for mulch.
Remove all plastic bags, lights, tinsel, ornaments and tree stands. Place tree, completely bare, at your designated collection point during this period of time.
After the first two weeks in January, the curbside hauler will begin collecting any remaining Christmas trees as regular trash.  Each tree replaces a can or bag in the normal trash limit.
For questions, contact the Public Works Department at 717-849-2245.



Refuse Districts

In York City, there are two refuse districts.  With some exceptions, roughly the City is divided in half along Market Street to form the two refuse districts.
Each of these two areas are then broken down into several routes which requires multiple trucks and crews to complete a variety of collections.
On any given Monday or Tuesday, there are approximately 6 trash crews, 4 recycling crews and 2 yard waste crews working in the same refuse district.  Each have their own route and may pass by your home enroute to their assigned area.  (Yard Waste collections run March 1 – December 15, weather permitting.)
Please hold missed collection reports until the morning after scheduled collections.  This ensures that crews have completed routes and driver’s logs have been received by the City from the hauler.  These daily logs show any collection issues they encountered (Examples: road closed with construction, car blocking access to alley collections, oversize/overweight trash containers, scheduled large items with evidence of bedbugs not bagged and sealed, large-items not scheduled, contaminated recyclables or contaminated yard waste, etc).
The order in which collection routes are run may vary at any time and customers are reminded that collections may be earlier or later than they are generally accustomed to.  Collections begin as early as 6 a.m. and may continue as late as 9 p.m.
Crews will not return for items that were not placed out on time.
To ensure collections, place items at the designated collection point by 6 a.m. on assigned collection days.  Each property has only ONE designated collection point.  Items that are placed out late, after crews have already gone through, must be pulled back inside and held until the next regularly scheduled collection day.



Needles/Sharps * Medication * Paint *Tires & More

Cardboard
This is a mandated recyclable material and all residential and commercial/institutional customers, must empty, flatten and bundle cardboard boxes with twine or place flattened boxes inside another cardboard box or in the recycling container (maximum bundles: 3′ x 3′ and 40 pounds). Place cardboard for collection, alongside or inside the recycling container, only on your first collection day each week.
Note: Boxes from tissues, cereal and other foods, snack bars, shoes, toys and similar products like paper towel and toilet tissue rolls are considered paperboard/chipboard and (CURRENTLY) should be placed in the normal trash.
Cooking Oil
When disposing of cooking oil, place in a heavy-duty plastic bottle with a tight fitting lid.  Discard in a securely tied trash bag (This bottle should NOT be recycled).
Lumber
Small quantities of building lumber may be placed for regular trash collection. The wood must be cut down and securely bundled. (Maximum bundle size: 3′ long and 40 pounds) Each bundle of lumber replaces a bag of trash.
Medication
Unused medication should never be flushed down toilets.  Instead, mix unused medication with undesirables such as coffee grounds or used cat litter and place in regular trash for incineration.
Occasionally, there are medication drop-off programs held by local Police Departments.
Needles/Sharps
When disposing of needles, scapel blades, broken ampoules, or anything used on patients that may be considered contaminated, place them in a heavy-duty plastic bottle (such as a laundry detergent bottle) with a tight fitting lid.  Discard in a securely tied trash bag (This bottle should NOT be recycled).
Motor oil
Outlets for used motor oil are ever changing. Contact the York County Solid Waste & Refuse Authority at 717-845-1066 or visit www.ycswa.com for the most up-to-date listing of facilities throughout the county that accept used motor oil.
Paint and Paint Products
Add cat litter to liquid paint/product to absorb most of the moisture.  Then, securely seal all containers before placing them, in small quantities, in securely tied trash bags with normal trash.  Do not place open containers of liquid separately for collection and do not place loose in trash cans with no tied trash bag.  To avoid any mess, it is also recommended to surround the cans with crumbled newspapers inside the bags of trash because everything is compacted in the collection vehicles.
Tires
ONLY Residential Units/Customers may place up to 2 passenger tires, off the rim, for regular trash collection. Each tire replaces a bag of trash and counts toward the overall bag limit. However, tires on the rim must be scheduled for large-item collection.
Commercial Units/Customers may NOT place any tires for curbside collection.  This is considered ILLEGAL DUMPING and fines may be imposed up to $600 per occurrence.  The public is encouraged to report any person dumping tires to Public Works at 717-849-2245.  Get a good description of the person(s) and a license of their vehicle (security video and photos are great too).
For Residential Units/Customers only … to schedule up to 2 tires on the rim, call 8-12 days in advance.

Home  News  Temporary Phone and Abbreviated Large-Item Scheduling 





Temporary Phone and Abbreviated Large-Item Scheduling
November 30, 2020 at 5:10 pm. 


Monday Through Thursday 10 A.M. – 1 P.M.
“LIVE” Calls Only (Effective 11/30/20) 
Due to a surge of COVID cases, most York City offices are closed to the public effective immediately.  Most staff are working from home.
To schedule large item collection, please call “LIVE” Monday through Thursday 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at this temporary cell number 717-600-7055.  Because calls are handled one at a time, customers may get a voice message even during these hours.  This simply means that our staff is on another call.  Please dial back in a couple minutes.
To report a “missed” collection related to trash, household items that are already scheduled, recycling, or yard waste, York City customers may call the temporary number during the listed hours (OR) email khill@yorkcity.org or cdennis@yorkcity.org to report the missed collection.  Please include your name, phone number, address and pick up point, along with what was missed and when it was missed.
Do not leave any messages on the normal large item line or on the temporary cell phone. Those messages will not be returned.
Your continued understanding and patience is very much appreciated.
