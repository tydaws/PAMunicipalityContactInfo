Falls Township Floodplain Ordinance
Falls Township is required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to adopt an ordinance regulating development within flood hazard areas. FEMA has developed new floodplain maps which reflect changes to the previous maps from May 18, 1999. The new floodplain maps which will go into effect on March 16, 2015 indicate properties located within the Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHA). Many, although not all property owners will be required to obtain flood insurance, even if there is no record of a flood on the property. The development standards limit development within flood hazard areas, including accessory structures and material stored outside.
Adoption of a floodplain ordinance is mandated by the federal government in order for properties within the jurisdiction to obtain federally subsidized flood insurance. If Falls Township fails to enforce the floodplain ordinance, no property within the Township will be eligible to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), including those who already have federally subsidized flood insurance. Properties in flood hazard areas that do not have floodplain insurance may not be eligible for a mortgage.
What does this mean for you?
In simple terms, if the Township fails to enforce this new ordinance, you may be unable to obtain a mortgage to buy or sell property in a flood hazard area. In the event of a flood, you will not have insurance to repair or replace damaged property. The following links will direct you to floodplain information regarding your property and NFIP information.

About Falls Township

About Falls Township
Falls Township, located in Lower Bucks County, is an area rich in history. Even before William Penn became the proprietor of Pennsylvania in 1681, a number of colonists had come to Falls. The first group of settlers to take up permanent residence in the village were the English Quakers.
Today, Falls Township is a suburban Philadelphia township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, United States. Portions of Fairless Hills and Levittown, Pennsylvania, are located in the township

Mitigation and Recovery Information 











We wanted to send out a reminder for the Mitigation and Recovery Webpage created by Bucks County Emergency Management and the Bucks County Planning Commission. The webpage serves as an information hub for county, state, and federal information for homeowners, business owners, and municipal officials. 
Over the course of 2021, Bucks County received, and diligently passed along, substantial information pertaining to recovery efforts/information for COVID-19, July Floods, and Tropical Storm IDA. The county also received an abundance of Hazard Mitigation Assistance Program information, shortly after adopting its 5-year Hazard Mitigation Plan revision.
This website will continue to be updated and revised to enhance usability and to maintain relevant information, especially after a disaster declaration. The county hopes that this webpage will serve as useful tool.  The county remains open to constructive feedback on the webpage to help enhance the data offerings and to continue to improve its ease of use and applicability.
The Mitigation/Recovery webpage can be viewed here: Mitigation & Recovery Information | Bucks County, PA and accessed from the county EMA webpage: Emergency Management Agency | Bucks County, PA.

There are two video links below on how to access the ClearCast & ClearAccess machines.
This first video shows how to use the ClearCast machine. These are the standard options and every precinct will have two of these machines:

Residents Ask EIT-Related Questions During Falls Info Session
About two dozen Falls residents attended a recent earned income tax information session and asked various questions related to filing requirements and taxable income.

Please click on the box below to read the entire article, view the EIT Informational meeting video and view handouts from Keystone Collections Group for residents and businesses.

Retro Fitness of Fairless Hills Bill Zolnowski has been going to the gym and bodybuilding his whole life. When it came time to start a business, Zolnowski blended his fitness expertise with his entrepreneurial spirit to become the owner of the Retro Fitness in Fairless Hills.
“I’ve worked in sales 20 plus years,” he said. “I always just wanted to own my own business.”
And while the thought of opening a “Bill’s Gym” crossed his mind, owning a franchise location seemed a bit easier.
Anchored by Funzilla and Big Lots in the Lincoln Highway shopping center, the gym, which had opened 10 years prior, was in bad shape when Zolnowski took the helm in August 2021. The signature red and yellow walls made for gaudy backdrops behind dilapidated fitness equipment. Danielle Pellegrini, Zolnowski’s fitness director, who at the time was a member, described her boss as being the catalyst who “saved the gym.”

Falls Seeks Residents to Fill Volunteer Roles on Various Boards
Would you like to help guide the future business initiatives, historic preservation, and neighborhood traffic concerns in Falls Township?
Falls Township is seeking volunteers to serve on ten advisory boards. The level of involvement varies, with some bodies meeting on an as-needed basis, while others play a larger or more active role.
Serving on boards, commissions and committees is a great way for residents to stay updated about the topics of greatest interest. Volunteers can take pride in helping to shape their community now and into the future.

Falls OKs EIT for 2023
Against the backdrop of dwindling host community fees from Waste Management and to prevent financially impacting senior citizens and residents living on fixed incomes, the Falls Township Supervisors begrudgingly approved enacting a 1-percent earned income tax. 
Following a presentation from Peter Angelides of EConsult Solutions Inc., and comments and questions from the Supervisors and several residents, the board on Monday voted 4-1 in favor of implementing the EIT, which took effect on Jan. 1, 2023. Supervisor John Palmer cast the lone no vote.

Over the past few months, the stay at home order has directly affected the volumes of household waste, recycling and yard waste that families are placing at the curb each week. The amount of materials we are collecting has increased by 30%, which in turn, directly increases the length of time it takes for our drivers and helpers to service your community. We are working to add additional staff to accommodate this increased volume to avoid service delays in the future. We truly appreciate your patience, as we work to ensure the health and safety of our employees and all the residents of Falls Township. If you have any concerns or questions, please feel free contact us at 1-800-869-5566.

Trash Collection

When should trash be placed at the curb?Place trash and recyclables out after 6:00 p.m. the evening before your pickup day. Place containers so they are not blocked by parked vehicles.
What size containers should I use?Household waste containers must be between 20 and 35 gallons, and may not exceed 50 pounds in weight. Use strudy plastic or metal containers with handles and detachable lids.
Recyclables should be placed in a recycle bin or can clearly labeled as “Recyclables.” The only recyclable items which can be placed in a bag are paper items such as newspapers.
Cut large items such as carpet and branches into lengths of four feet or less and tie into manageable bundles.

Recycling - Remember that Recycling is MANDATORY, required by State Law.
Municipal and state regulations require that residents, commercial establishments and non-residential establishments recycle all recyclable materials. Commonly recycled materials include:

Paper – newspaper, office/copy paper, glossy paper, color paper, cardboard, junk mail, phone books, cereal/cracker boxes
Plastic – bottles and jugs No. 1-7
Glass – clear, green and brown containers
Metal – aluminum, steel, tin, and bimetal cans and containers

You should check with your hauler for a complete list of acceptable recyclable materials.
Are Things Really Being Recycled?
This question often comes up. People are concerned that not all of the materials they put in their recycle bin are recycled. Their concern is that some end up in landfills. This leads some to minimize their recycling efforts. According to several major waste management firms in Montgomery County, all of the acceptable recycled materials listed above are being recycled.
You should continue to recycle all of the items listed above.
Things You Should Not Put into Your Recycle Bin
Here is a list of things that cannot be recycled and should not be put into your recycle bin:

Foam containers and cups, even if they have a recycle symbol on them,
Cups coated with wax or plastic such as soda cups,
Plastic bags such as grocery store bags (You can often take these bags back to the grocery store.),
Flexible packaging such as chip bags or juice pouches,
Plastic wrap,
Container caps,
Diapers, yes, some people throw soiled diapers into their recycle bins.

Avoid Contamination of Recycling Materials with Food or Liquids
Materials contaminated with food or liquid cannot be recycled. Here is what you should do:

Check that the material is recyclable. Look for the recycle symbol on items.
Rinse jars, bottles, and cans that have visible residue in them. A quick rinse is usually adequate.
Throw away heavily soiled items.

Recycling containers can be purchased at the Township building, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The price for the 22 gallon container is $20.

Snow Related Information 











At the March 3, 2015 Supervisor's Meeting, a discussion was held with the Board and key staff members on the topic of snow emergencies in Falls Township.  Here is an excerpt of that meeting featuring this discussion:







Snow plays a major role in our area every winter.  At times, winter weather advisories may be in effect, Code Blue shelters may be activated, and in extreme cases, Snow Emergency and States of Emergency may be declared.  
If, at any time, any of these situations are put into effect, Falls Township will make every effort to notify the public, using our website, cable channel, and social media platforms to reach as many people as possible.
Certain ordinances come into play when these weather conditions are met.  These ordinances are to try and ensure the safety of the residents while maintaining the services needed.  Many of these ordinances are posted below, but if you have questions, please contact us directly and we will try and assist you as much as possible.
§ 203-28. Parking prohibited when no emergency declared.On all streets throughout the Township, whenever the depth of snow on each individual street shall reach an accumulation that requires plowing of the streets, parking shall be prohibited until such time as 12 hours after cessation of the snow has passed or the street is cleared of snow and ice, whichever occurs last. If the accumulation of snow occurs between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m., vehicle owners will have until 9:00 a.m. to remove their vehicles from the street, and parking will be prohibited for a period of 12 hours starting at 9:00 a.m.
§ 203-29. Snow, sleet and ice removal required.After each fall of snow or sleet, or after ice has formed on any sidewalk situate in the Township, it shall be the duty of the owner, tenant or occupant of the property on which such sidewalk is located to completely clear and remove all such snow, sleet or ice from such sidewalks to keep them safe for pedestrian travel, but in no event shall such snow, sleet or ice remain on sidewalks more than 24 hours after cessation of such snow, sleet or ice.
§ 203-30. Throwing snow onto highways.It shall be illegal to throw, shovel or plow snow into or on any highway, road or street within the Township from an adjoining property. Any such offense shall be subject to the violations and penalties enforceable under this article.
§ 203-31. Authorization for removal and impoundment.The Township Manager, the Chief of Police, and/or an authorized designee are hereby authorized to remove and impound or to order the removal and impounding of any vehicle parked on any of the streets, highways or public property in the Township in violation of any provision or any ordinance of the Township. The removal of such vehicle(s) shall be in conformity with the provisions of Chapter 206
