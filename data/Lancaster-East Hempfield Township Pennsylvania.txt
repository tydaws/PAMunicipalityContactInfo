Church St. Nolt Rd. Master Concept Plan for Recreation use
 Church St. Nolt Rd. Master Concept Plan for Recreation use. The Board of Supervisors desires to introduce you to a Master Concept Plan to create a recreation area on 50-acres at the corner of Church/Nolt (Sod Farm).  At this time there is neither Township funding set aside or planned, nor is there a timeline in place, for any improvements to this site.  The Township was approached by the Hempfield Youth Association which represents youth playing baseball, softball and soccer.  They explained their need for more field space.  The park/recreation group had been approached by other groups also looking for space.  The park/recreation group looked at several areas in the Township and the Board of Supervisors suggested the 50-acre sod farm at Church/Nolt.  The Board approved moving forward with a master concept plan which will be used to provide guidance in planning how to best utilize this space for recreation.  What you see depicted is a draft of a master concept plan.  This plan has been a topic for open discussion at the last three Board of Supervisors meetings.  The open discussion is to gather input from residents and users.  This is just a plan, a starting point for discussion with the public and the various groups that are in need of facilities.  The recreation area will take years to develop as was noted, there is currently no funding set aside in the Township budget.  The master concept plan was formally presented to the Board of Supervisors at their meeting on January 18th.  The Board has received feedback from the last several Board meetings.  Staff is preparing a resident survey in order to allow more public feedback regarding this land parcel.  An open house is also being planned.  Both the survey and open house information will be posted on our social media pages and newsletter. Master Concept Plan - Church/Nolt
