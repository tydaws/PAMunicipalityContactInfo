This charming City is surrounded by forests, streams, and wildlife; it is a nature-lovers and hunter’s paradise.  For the wildlife lovers, the Elk herds in Elk County are just 18 miles to the north.  This quaint City is a powerhouse for baseball and softball. DuBois hosts multiple tournaments at the prestigious Showers, Heindl, and Stern fields; such as, the Small College World Series, the Eastern Regional Little League Tournament, the PIAA State games and PBR to name a few.  DuBois’s ballfields are rated the best in the tri-state area. We also have culture in the Reitz Theater, a local theater group which puts on plays throughout the year; the Winkler Gallery, a place for budding artists to perfect their craft; and Musicfest held Thursday evenings in the summer on the stage in the DuBois Memorial Park.  Penn State University has a local campus here.  We also boast a state of the art medical facility at Penn Highlands Healthcare, and the DuBois Regional Airport is a mere eight miles from the City center.  DuBois is also surrounded by major highways: US 219, Interstate 80 and Route 322 making us an excellent hub for commerce.   Learn MoreNews & AnnouncementsDumpster DayDumpster Day is the first Wednesday of every month at the City Garage, located at 10 Parkway Drive.
