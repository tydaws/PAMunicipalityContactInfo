Wipes & Paper TowelsAre you using wipes and paper towels to clean and disinfect? But Don’t Risk a Sewer Back UP!
Toilet paper is made to disintegrate. Everything else should go in the trash. Because it’s NOT flushable and won’t breakdown. Wipes and paper towels will tangle into a big lump and block sewer lines. If a pipe in your neighborhood is blocked, sewage could back up into your house which means a very expensive $$ mess for you.
