New Parks and Recreation Registration Website Additional Resources
The new Parks and Recreation registration system will be used to register for classes, trips, summer park program, and pavilion rentals. 
Springettsbury Parks and Recreation Website: https://secure.rec1.com/PA/springettsbury-township-pa/catalog?fbclid=IwAR23elA55hfsTl9nBqCPFtiZoPKUa1KVaDUiwwR9cwNkpKXHmHR3NhMwM74
When the program launches on March 13 all registrants will be required to create a new account. The primary account holder (parent) will be the first user created on the account and should always be an adult. If setting up a family account, create a "parent" first before you add a child user to the account. 
For assistance in understanding how you will set-up your account, please utilize these tools:
- Guide to learn about Primary Account Holders vs Account Members.
- Guide to Create a Public Account 
- Guide to Create a Public Account on Mobile
- Guide to Log in to CivicRec with Facebook or Google (New Users)
 
Notes: 
Summer Playground Program Registration Opens March 20!
Spring trips, programs and classes are available now for registration!

Important Information About Your Sewer Account
Trash Inquiries:  Penn Waste, Inc. 717-767-4456Water Inquiries:  York Water Co. 717-845-3601 
If you are a new owner of property, or are selling property in Springettsbury Township: 

Your settlement company must submit a Sewer Account Request Form to the Township along with a $20 certification fee.
The Township reports the current balance due, the last period billed, and the regular billing amount to the settlement company. 
Your settlement company will use this information to prorate the amount due based on the settlement date.  They will determine what amount is the responsibility of the seller and what amount is the responsibility of the buyer.  (The seller will be reimbursed by the buyer at settlement, for the period of time from settlement through the end of the billing period.)

If you are a renter:

You are not responsible to the Township for sewer charges. 
The owner of a property is responsible to the Township for sewer charges. 
If, as a renter, you have an agreement with the property owner that you will pay the sewer bill, we can send the bill directly to you.  The property owner must complete a Sewer Account Request Form, notifying us that they wish their sewer bill to be sent to you. (The owner's name still appears on the bill, it is just mailed in care of renter/occupant)

Springettsbury Township prepares bills ONLY for sewer charges.  All inquiries for garbage should be made to Penn Waste, Inc. 717-767-4456.  All inquiries for water should go to York Water Co. 717-845-3601.
Sewer charges are billed quarterly.  Bills are due:  February 1, May 1, August 1, and November 1.  We must receive payment by this date so that penalties and interest are not charged to your account.  We are not responsible for bills not received or payments not received by the due date.
