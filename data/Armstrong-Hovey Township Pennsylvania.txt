                Three Butler County residents killed in Armstrong County crash

A vehicle crash around 6:15 p.m. Monday in Hovey Township, Armstrong County, claimed the lives of three Butler County residents.
According to a news release from Armstrong County Coroner Brian Myers, the head-on crash between two vehicles happened on North Riverview Drive near its intersection with Bennertown Road.
Myers said Ronald E. Stockdill, 50, of Sligo, Clarion County lost control of his Chevrolet Colorado, crossed the center line and hit head-on a Pontiac Grand Prix driven in the opposite direction by Holly Tweed, 37, of Butler.
Tweed and both of her passengers, Lindsay R. Scott, 24, and Jason R. Redenbach, 39, both of Bruin, were pronounced dead at the scene by Myers.
“None the subjects was wearing a seat belt,” Myers said. He said all three deaths were caused by “multiple blunt force traumas.”
Stockdill was taken to UPMC Presbyterian.
State police are  investigating the crash.
The coroner’s office and police were assisted at the scene by Parker Volunteer Fire Department and Emlenton Ambulance.
