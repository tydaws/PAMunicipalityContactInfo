WE ARE EXPERIENCING WEBSITE ISSUES!!!!!!!!

Posted on February 15, 2023  by  Greg Stein 


UPDATE: For the past month we have experienced problems that have prevented us from loading documents on our website.  We are working with our PSATS webmaster to try to fix the “file size” issue. In the meantime, the most recent copies of the Agenda and Minutes are posted on the bulletin board at the Township Building. Or, contact us and request a copy.

Get on the Agenda! Please!

Posted on May 5, 2022  by  Greg Stein 


Please contact the Township Secretary no later than the Friday before each monthly meeting if you have a request that will require action by the Board of Supervisors.  Failing to be on the agenda means that necessary resources may not be available to discuss your request. (for example, Attorney, Engineer, Sewage and Code Enforcement) Not being on the meeting agenda will delay action by the Board of Supervisors until the next public meeting (30 days).
