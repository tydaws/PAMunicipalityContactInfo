Welcome to Girard Township!

The Supervisors Regular Meeting on March 14th is cancelled.  The next meeting will be March 28th at 4:00 p.m.
FINAL NOTICE & PUBLIC EXPLANATION
OF A PROPOSED ACTVITY IN A 100 YEAR FLOODPLAIN & WETLAND
IN GIRARD TOWNSHIP, ERIE, COUNTY, PA
(February 24, 2023)
To: All interested Agencies, Groups and Individuals.
This is to give notice that the County of Erie, on behalf of Girard Township, has conducted an evaluation of the multi-year funded Girard Township Miller Road Replacement Project as required by Executive Orders 11988 and 11990 in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR 55.20 Subpart C Procedures for Making Determinations on Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands. The proposed project involves replacement of the Miller Road culvert over Brandy Run. The subject portion of Brandy Run is located in a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Zone A Special Flood Hazard Area (floodplain). Additionally, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, National Wetland Inventory (NWI) mapping shows a wetland area adjacent to the project area.
PROJECT SUMMARY
Project Name: Girard Township Miller Road Culvert Replacement Project
Project Number: (S-20/21/22-E-33-6-5)
Project Location: The culvert is located on Miller Road in Girard Township, Erie County, PA. Miller Road is located between Tannery Road and Daggett Road.
Purpose of Project: The existing Miller Road culvert crossing over Brandy Run is in poor condition with areas of significant structural failure, and the culvert must be replaced. If the existing culvert pipe is not replaced, the structural condition will continue to decline to the point of complete structural failure. In addition to causing the closure of Miller Road, the failure of the existing culvert will likely involve collapse into Brandy Run, which will have negative impacts to the environmental condition and floodplain area of Brandy Run and adjacent sensitive natural areas.
Project Description: Multi-year CDBG funds and local monies will provide for removal and disposal of the existing Miller Road culvert which has a 24’ span, 12’ rise, and a total length of approximately 85’ (including beveled end sections). The replacement culvert will be a 60’ long corrugated structural steel plate arch with a 24’ span and 12’ rise. The replacement culvert will also include corrugated structural aluminum plate headwalls and wing walls at both ends. The project will include all appurtenant and incidental work as necessary.
Funding Source/Amount: $293,826 (Multi-year CDBG funds) + $113,524 (Local monies) = $407,350 (+/-)
The evaluation was undertaken to determine:
(1) Alternatives to locating the project in a floodplain/wetland area.
(2) Identification of direct and indirect impacts associated with occupying or modifying the floodplain/wetland and the beneficial or harmful impacts to the floodplain/floodplain — direct and indirect; short term and long term.
(3) Identification of mitigation measures, if any, to minimize impacts to and preserve the benefits of the floodplain/wetland.
(4) Whether it is possible to modify or relocate the project and why. If there are no alternatives, explain why the project should occur.
FINDINGS/EXPLANATION
(1) Because the project involves the in-kind replacement of the existing culvert structure with a new structure, the project must be undertaken in the proposed location. The structure type (corrugated metal pipe arch), and structural condition of the culvert is such that suitable repair of the existing culvert is not achievable. Therefore, complete replacement of the existing culvert is proposed.
(2) The portion of the Miller Road roadway traversing the floodplain area is an elevated embankment, and the roadway area is located above (beyond) the limit of the floodplain. The replacement of the culvert will be undertaken within the “footprint” of the elevated roadway embankment area without direct impact to the adjacent mapped floodplain areas. Furthermore, adjacent wetland areas located within the floodplain will not be directly impacted by the culvert replacement project. Potential indirect impacts will be fully addressed through the PA DEP permit process as outlined below.
(3) The culvert replacement project will require a Pennsylvania Water Obstruction and Encroachment General Permit No. 11 issued through the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP), and the project will be undertaken in accordance with all imposed permit conditions and requirements. Said permit conditions and requirements will include implementation of strict erosion and sedimentation control measures during construction to protect adjacent sensitive natural resources as well as Pennsylvania Natural Diversity Inventory (PNDI) coordination with jurisdictional agencies regarding potential project impacts to threatened and endangered species.
(4) The existing Miller Road culvert crossing over Brandy Run is in poor condition with areas of significant structural failure, and the culvert must be replaced. The structure type (corrugated metal pipe arch), and structural condition of the culvert is such that suitable repair of the existing culvert is not achievable. Therefore, complete replacement of the existing culvert is proposed. If the existing culvert pipe is not replaced, the structural condition will continue to decline to the point of complete structural failure. In addition to causing the closure of Miller Road, the failure of the existing culvert will likely involve collapse into Brandy Run, which will have negative impacts to the environmental condition and floodplain area of Brandy Run and adjacent sensitive natural areas. Therefore, the mitigation measure that provides the least impact to the Brandy Run floodplain, associated stream and wetland areas, and flow patterns is replacement of the existing culvert pipe with a new culvert pipe.
