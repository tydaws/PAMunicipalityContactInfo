Additional Township InformationTownship Newsletter – See our link at the bottom of this page to view our latest newsletter.
*****************************************************************************************************************
The MS4 Program – When stormwater runoff enters municipal owned storm drains and that portion of the municipality has been deemed an “urbanized area” (urbanized areas are determined by Census Data), the municipality is required to develop and implement a stormwater management program and apply for various permits to reduce the contamination of stormwater runoff similar to businesses that release water as a byproduct of their operations. The Municipal Separate Storm Sewer (MS4) Permit requires municipalities to monitor stormwater, educate targeted audiences about water pollution, and enact and enforce stormwater ordinances, along with various other stormwater prevention and protection activities.
The PA Department of Environmental Protection has produced a guide for property owners that explains and illustrates Best Management Practices (BMP) for Stormwater. This guide is primarily intended for landowners who have (or will have) a stormwater BMP on their property, but the guide contains useful information for any landowner. Please click on the link below to read more about BMP.
SW_Booklet_2017-1 Homeowners Guide to Stormwater Best Management Practices
As part of the Township’s continuing efforts to educate the public about water pollution, as required by our MS4 permit, we are pleased to provide the following information for your review:
Every Drop Counts (Save Water by Fixing Leaks) – Free Testing Kit available at the Township Office (while supplies last. Click on the link to view the flyer for the testing kit.
 Every Drop Counts
How to Save Water – Everyday activities we all take for granted can use a lot of water; this chart supplied by the American Water Works Association provides alternatives to help you save water, and lower water meter readings will also translate into lower sewer bills. Click on the link to open the flyer.

 Lower Heidelberg Township has had a long and illustrious history. When driving our roadways, one encounters modern houses and businesses, then rolling fields of corn, rye, and wheat. In the south, Hains Church stands high atop a hill overlooking Wernersville in the Lebanon Valley and beyond to Cushion Peak in the South Mountains. In the north, Brownsville Road hugs the ridge affording panoramic vistas of Blue Marsh Lake and the majestic Blue Mountains in the distance. In between, old stone farmhouses, wooden barns, and deserted homesteads nestled in the hills stand as reminders of a by-gone era.
