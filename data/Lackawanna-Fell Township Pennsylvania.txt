Important Information on Stormwater Taxes 
Posted byFelltownshipDecember 10, 2020December 10, 2020Posted inUncategorized 


HAVE YOU EVER SEEN SIGNS READING “STOP THE RAIN TAX” AND WONDERED WHAT THAT IS ALL ABOUT?  MAYBE THIS WILL HELP!
There are a great many pollutants that are carried into streams, rivers, and other waterways by stormwater (rain and melting snow).  Things such as sediment, oil, dog waste, salt, and lawn & garden nutrients are washed into storm drains and ultimately into surface waters. 
These pollutants degrade the water, kill fish and wildlife, and limit recreational use of many of Pennsylvania’s rivers and lakes.  
In order to protect waterways, the Federal Government has decreed that certain urbanized areas must take steps to control stormwater runoff.  These steps are part of a program known as MS4 (Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System). Some government agencies have enacted a fee to control, treat, or limit the stormwater runoff entering our waterways.  Many people have called it a “Rain Tax”.Regardless of the measures taken to control stormwater runoff, something has to be implemented now to protect waterways from further degradation.  
Be STORMWATER SMART and read more on MS4 at http://www.dep.state.pa.us or www.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater-discharges-municipal-sources. There are also other stormwater links on the KBA website www.kbapc.net
