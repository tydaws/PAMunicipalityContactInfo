When you enter Kidder Township you are entering the front door of the Pocono’s.  The Township covers 70-square miles of beautifully wooded terrain in the northern tip of Carbon County.  It is primarily a heavily wooded area easily accessible. If taking I-476 (formerly called the Northeast Extension of the PA Turnpike) use Exit 95 and if taking Interstate 80, Exit 277 / Lake Harmony or Exit 284 / Blakeslee.  We’re only 20 minutes south of Wilkes-Barre.  The Township encircles Hickory Run State Park and has thousands of acres of Pennsylvania State Game Lands which provide excellent camping, hiking, cross country skiing and hunting.  The many resorts within Kidder Township offer facilities for conventions, ski slopes, golf courses and lakes for boating and fishing so there is something for everyone year round. Kidder Township is a zoned community that consists primarily of vacation and seasonal homes from small rustic A-frames to large glass fronted contemporaries suitable for executive entertaining.  The full time residents are, rightfully so, proud of their Township and strongly support the governing ordinances that provide building codes, anti-littering laws, trespass and abandoned vehicle controls as well as other laws that promote living in a civilized community.
As many have experienced, it is a popular vacation and seasonal home location, governed and patrolled to keep it as peaceful, tranquil and beautiful as it is.  Whatever your reason for being in Kidder Township, we welcome you!
