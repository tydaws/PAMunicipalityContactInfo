F.I.N.D.S. PROGRAM (Family Information Network Data System)




OVERVIEW
The F.I.N.D.S. program allows residents to voluntarily register any family member that might walk away from their residence and not find their way back home, or make the Police Department aware of a family memberâs special needs that would be helpful in the event that Police come into contact with their family member.
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM?
The purpose of the F.I.N.D.S. program is to give Northampton Police a secure database to quickly ascertain important information about individuals with special needs, so that we can speed up the process of getting them help as soon and as effectively as possible.Â 
WHAT SPECIAL NEEDS MAKES A PERSON ELIGIBLE?

Any older adult who may walk away from their home and not find their way back.
Any child or adult with cognitive disabilities.
Any child or adult with intellectual disabilities.
Any child or adult with any other physical or mental impairment.

WHO IS ELIGIBLE?

Residents of Northampton Township
Temporary residents of Northampton Township
Students attending a school in Northampton Township
Someone who is employed in Northampton Township

WHAT TYPE OF INFORMATION IS KEPT ON FILE?
In short, only the information that you believe is necessary for the Police to have.Â  You control what we have on file.Â  Some information may include:

Name, Age, Home Address.
Emergency contact information
A recent photograph of the family member (to help us identify the family member more accurately).
Medication needs.
If they have special medical equipment such as a pacemaker.
If they have medical concerns such as being a diabetic.
Problems with communication (Advising us about the best way to communicate with the family member).
Letting us know if they are fearful of Uniformed Officers.

HOW CAN I GET MORE INFORMAITON ABOUT ENROLLING A FAMILY MEMBER?
The F.I.N.D.S registration form is not available online.Â  Â Anyone looking for more information on the F.I.N.D.S. program should contact the Northampton Township Police Quality of Life Unit at (215) 322-6111 during regular business hours.

Overview
Seventy percent (70%) of the Township's total revenue comes from taxes. This revenue is used for police and fire protection, street repair and maintenance, recreation services and maintenance of facilities, library services, rescue services, capital improvement projects, and debt service.
Please use separate checks for each tax bill. SORRY, NO CASH IS ACCEPTED.
Real Estate Tax
The Board of Supervisors approves the real estate millage rate for the Township as part of the annual budget approval process. The following is the 2022 millage rate and breakdown:



General Purpose
8.8747 mills


Fire Services
3.000 mills


Recreation Services
1.6280 mills


Ambulance Services
0.7500 mills


Debt Service
4.5597 mills


Library Services
1.7284 mills


Road Equipment
0.5703 mills


Road Maintenance Fund
0.5000 mills






Total Millage Rate 
21.6111 mills



*Property taxes are expressed in terms of mills per dollar of assessed value. One mill is equal to one-tenth (1/10) of a penny or 1/1000 of a dollar. The property tax formula is the mill rate (divided by 1,000) multiplied by the assessed value of the property. For example, with a millage rate of 14.9111 mills and a $36,000 assessed value of a home the tax rate would be:
0.0216111 X $36,000=$777.99
Vince Deon is our elected tax collector and is responsible for collecting Real Estate Taxes. Please click here for his website and contact information.
Earned Income Tax (EIT)
An earned income tax (EIT) of 1% on gross earnings for individuals and net profits for businesses is imposed on everyone living or working in the Township. This tax is distributed evenly between the Township and Council Rock School District, each receiving 0.5%. The collection of the EIT generates 31% of the revenues received by the Township.
Local Services Tax (LST)
A local services tax is paid by everyone working in the Township. The tax is $52.00 per year. This tax is usually collected by payroll withholding and remitted to the tax collector. Any individual making less than $12,000 in a calendar year can file for an exemption with their employer.
Keystone Collections Group is under contract with the Township to collect both Earned Income Taxes, Per Capita Taxes and Local Services Taxes. Please click here for their website and frequently asked questions.

Northampton Township 
A great place to live and call home











Northampton TownshipÂ is a second-class township in Bucks County, Pennsylvania,Â about 12 miles northeast of Philadelphia.Â The population was 39,726 at the 2010 census.
The Township is made up of the following unincorporated communities and census-designated places:

Churchville
Holland
Ivyland
Richboro

History of Northampton Township
Northampton Township officially became a township on December 14, 1722, covering 26.5 miles.Â  Although the origin of the name of the Township has never been officially verified, it is believed to have stemmed from the County of Northampton in the English midlands-one hundred miles north of London.Â 
The first settlers of the Township were English, followed by the Dutch and the French Huguenots.Â  The Dutch brought with them a deep love for religion and founded churches wherever they settled.Â  The oldest church in the Township is the Addisville Reformed Church in Richboro, which traces its history to 1710.Â  Today there are churches of many dominations and a Synagogue servicing the religious needs of the community.Â Â 
By the middle of the 19th century, the Township had five small villages: Jacksonville, Richboro, Addisville, Churchville, and Rocksville.Â  Today, Jacksonville is considered Ivyland, Addisville is Richboro, and Rocksville is Holland.Â 
The Township began as a farming community, with just a few settlements near crossroads or mills. Not until the late 1800âs, did the villages of Richboro and Churchville grow, as retired farmers decided to build homes "in town."Â  Many of the homes in the center of Richboro were builtÂ asÂ small stores andÂ wereÂ homes of retired farmers.Â Â 
Life was never dull for farmers or their counterparts on the farm. Activities included big political parades and Memorial Day parades to the local cemetery, church and school picnics, serenades of banging pots and pans at the homes of newlyweds, carnivals and dinners at the firehouse, chautauquas when people gathered to enjoy plays, reading poetry, and listen to and partake in discussions, and of course, the trips to and competition in the county fairs. Today, many landmarks have changed or disappeared, and new activities have replaced the old.Â  Most of the major roads in Northampton remained unpaved until the late 1930âs and early 1940âs.Â 
Even though the landscape looks very different from the birth of the Township, Northampton Township has remained a great place to live and call home. Many of Northampton's farms have become housing developments and the township is currently the home of 40,000 inhabitants who enjoy its free library, senior center,Â parks, nature center, golf courses, athletic fields and shopping centers.Â

Overview
Seventy percent (70%) of the Township's total revenue comes from taxes. This revenue is used for police and fire protection, street repair and maintenance, recreation services and maintenance of facilities, library services, rescue services, capital improvement projects, and debt service.
Please use separate checks for each tax bill. SORRY, NO CASH IS ACCEPTED.
Real Estate Tax
The Board of Supervisors approves the real estate millage rate for the Township as part of the annual budget approval process. The following is the 2022 millage rate and breakdown:



General Purpose
8.8747 mills


Fire Services
3.000 mills


Recreation Services
1.6280 mills


Ambulance Services
0.7500 mills


Debt Service
4.5597 mills


Library Services
1.7284 mills


Road Equipment
0.5703 mills


Road Maintenance Fund
0.5000 mills






Total Millage Rate 
21.6111 mills



*Property taxes are expressed in terms of mills per dollar of assessed value. One mill is equal to one-tenth (1/10) of a penny or 1/1000 of a dollar. The property tax formula is the mill rate (divided by 1,000) multiplied by the assessed value of the property. For example, with a millage rate of 14.9111 mills and a $36,000 assessed value of a home the tax rate would be:
0.0216111 X $36,000=$777.99
Vince Deon is our elected tax collector and is responsible for collecting Real Estate Taxes. Please click here for his website and contact information.
Earned Income Tax (EIT)
An earned income tax (EIT) of 1% on gross earnings for individuals and net profits for businesses is imposed on everyone living or working in the Township.

Record - information, regardless of physical form or characteristics, that documents a Township transaction or activity and is created, received or retained pursuant to law or in connection with a Township transaction, business or activity, including: a document; paper; letter; map; book; tape; photograph; film or sound recording; information stored or maintained electronically; and a data processed or image-processed document.
In General - the Open Records Officer shall:

Receive written requests for access to records submitted to the Township.
Review and respond to written requests in accordance with law, Board policy and administrative regulations.
Direct requests to other appropriate individuals in the Township or in another agency when necessary.
Monitor and record the Township's progress in responding to requests.
Issue interim and final responses to submitted requests.
Maintain a log of all record requests and their disposition.
Ensure Township staff are trained to perform assigned job functions relative to requests for access to records.

Specifically, upon receiving a request for access to a record, the Open Records Officer shall:

Note the date of receipt on the written request.
Compute and note on the written request the day on which the five-day period for response will expire.
If the written request is approved in full, maintain an electronic or paper copy of the written request, including all documents submitted with the request, until the request has been fulfilled.
If the written request is denied or denied in part, maintain the written request for thirty (30) days or, if an appeal is filed, until a final determination is issued or the appeal is deemed denied.

Procedure for Requesting Records
All written requests for access to a public record shall be submitted on the required form attached hereto as Attachment "A", or on the state form, and addressed to the Open Records Officer.
Written requests shall be submitted to the Township in person, by mail, to a designated facsimile machine (if any) or to a designated e-mail address (if any). Any request received by the Township after normal office hours, 4:30 p.m. E.S.T., or on a day when the Township offices are closed, shall be deemed received the next day on which the Township offices are open.
Each request must include the following information:

Identification or description of the requested record, in sufficient detail to enable the Township to ascertain which records are being requested.
Medium in which the record is requested.
Name and address of the individual to receive the Township's response.

Neither the Township nor the Open Records Officer shall require an explanation of the reason for the request or the intended use of the requested record, unless otherwise required by law.
Response to Request
Township employees shall be directed to forward requests for access to public records to the Open Records Officer. Requests not properly addressed to the Open Records Officer shall not be deemed received unless and until the Open Records Officer actually receives the written request.
Upon receipt of a written request for access to a record, the Open Records Officer shall determine if the requested record is a public record and if the Township has possession, custody or control of that record.
The Open Records Officer shall respond as promptly as possible under the circumstances then existing, and the initial response time shall not exceed five (5) business days from the date the written request is received by the Open Records Officer.
The initial response shall grant access to the requested record, deny access to the requested record, partially grant and partially deny access to the requested record, or notify the requestor of the need for an extension of time to fully respond.
Normally, records are available at the Township from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday each week except for certain holidays and when the offices are closed for emergencies.
Extension of Time
If the Open Records Officer determines that an extension of time is required to respond to a request, in accordance with the factors stated in Act 3, written notice of the need for an extension shall be sent within five (5) business days of receipt of request. The notice shall indicate that the request for access is being reviewed, the reason that the review requires an extension; and a reasonable date by which the response can be expected.
Up to a thirty (30) day extension for one (1) of the listed reasons does not require the consent of the requestor. If the response is not given by the specified date, it shall be deemed denied on the day following that date.
A requestor may consent in writing to an extension that exceeds thirty (30) days, in which case the request shall be deemed denied on the day following the date specified in the notice if the Open Records Officer has not provided a response by that date.
Granting Of Request
If the Open Records Officer determines that a request to inspect will be granted, the response shall inform the requestor that access is granted and either include information on the regular business hours of the administration office, provide electronic access, or state where the requestor may go to inspect the records or information electronically at a publically accessible site. The response shall state the amount of any applicable fee and a statement that all applicable fees shall be paid in order to receive access to the record requested and the medium in which the records will be provided.
If the Open Records Officer determines that a request to copy will be granted, the response shall inform the requestor that access is granted and either include information on the regular business hours of the administration office where the records can be retrieved, or state where the requestor may go to retrieve copies of the records. The response shall state the amount of the applicable fees, a statement that all applicable fees shall be paid in order to retrieve copies of the records requested, and the medium in which the records will be provided. The Open Records Officer may respond to a records request by notifying the requestor that the record is available through publicly accessible electronic means or that the Township shall provide access to inspect the record electronically. If the requestor, within thirty (30) days following receipt of the Township's notice, submits a written request to have the record converted to paper, the Township shall provide copies in printed form within five (5) days of receipt of the request for conversion to paper.
Prepayment of an estimate of fees is required if reproduction of the records is expected by the Open Records Officer to cost in excess of one hundred dollars ($100.00). The response of the Open Records Officer shall so state if prepayment is required. If the actual cost is less than the estimate, the Open Records Officer shall return the difference to the requestor. If the actual cost is higher than the estimate, the requestor shall pay the difference prior to the copies being given or sent to the requestor.
Denial of Request
The Open Records Officer may deny a request for access to or copies of a record if the requestor has made repeated requests for that same record and the repeated requests have placed an unreasonable burden on the Township.
The Open Records Officer may deny a request for access to a record when timely access is not possible due to a fire, flood or other disaster, or when access may cause physical damage or irreparable harm to the record. To the extent possible, the contents of a record shall be made accessible even when the record is physically unavailable due to fire, flood or other disaster.
Information that is not subject to access or is redacted from a public record which has been produced shall be deemed a denial as to that information.
If the Open Records Officer responds to a requestor that a copy of the requested record is available for delivery at the administration office and the requestor does not retrieve the record within sixty (60) days of the Township's response, the Township shall dispose of the copied records and retain any fees paid to date.
If a written request for access to a record is denied or deemed denied, the requestor may file an appeal with the state's Office of Open Records within fifteen (15) business days of the mailing date of the Open Records Officer's response or deemed denial.
If the Open Records Officer denies a request for access to or copies of a record, whether in whole or in part, a written response shall be sent within five (5) business days of receipt of the request. The response denying the request shall include the following:

Description of the record requested.
Specific reasons for denial.
Name, title, business address, business telephone number, and signature of the Open Records Officer on whose authority the denial is issued.
Date of the response.
Procedure for the requestor to appeal the denial of access or copies.
