2023 UPPER SALFORD TOWNSHIP NEWSLETTER


Click here to read up on the latest news in and around Upper Salford Township!  Please note that our website address is www.uppersalfordtownship.org or www.uppersalfordtownship.com.  We ask that you check out our website periodically for updates and important reminders!


PennDOT Update on the Old Skippack & Shelly/Schwenksville Road Intersection



UPDATE 4/28/23: The Township was notified that there will be contractors working night shift on Tuesday night, May 2nd, and the work is expected to last for only one night.  Local residents adjacent to the project will be notified.
Work is continuing for PennDOT’s Roundabout project at the intersection of Schwenksville/Shelly/Old Skippack.
Latest update: Stage 1 Detour will start on March 6, 2023 – Shelly Road & Schwenksville Roads will be closed. Stage 2 Detour will start on May 1st, 2023 – Old Skippack Road will be closed. Current anticipated reopening of the intersection is scheduled for July 13, 2023.


Motorists are advised to allow extra time when traveling through the work area because backups and delays will occur. All scheduled activities are weather dependent.  Under this improvement project, PennDOT will construct a single-lane roundabout to enhance traffic flow through the intersection and install new drainage facilities and roundabout lighting.  The purpose of the project is to reduce angle crashes and vehicular speeds; increase sight distance; and improve congestion through the intersection.  Due to the nature of the construction, a traffic detour will be utilized once the project moves from utility construction to roadway construction.  MEDIA CONTACT: Krys Johnson, 610-205-6797



Baghurst Remediation Update


EPA is in the process of constructing a water line for the Baghurst Remediation project.  Rahmer Park, including the parking lot, will be posted when closed during their construction phase.  Please avoid the area around the baseball field and do NOT park on the road or at the baseball field entrance! THIS IS AN ACTIVE CONSTRUCTION ZONE!! Trail parking at the Municipal Building is prohibited.  Thank you.   Click here for the latest information fact sheet from EPA.


2023 Septic Pumping Receipts Due by 12/31/2023


Reminders will go out at the end of March, if you are due in 2023.  If you get your septic system pumped, please be sure to submit your receipt to our office! You may email a copy to amy.uppersalford@comcast.net, mail a copy to PO Box 100 Salfordville PA 18958, or drop off a copy during normal office hours (M-F, 8am-4pm). Receipts will be due to our office prior to 12/31/2023 to avoid additional fines and penalties.  Please note that not all septic pumpers will send in your receipt to our office.  Remember, it is your responsibility, as the property owner, to make sure that we have an updated receipt on file. Septic pumping is due every 3 years, at a minimum, in accordance with the Upper Salford Township Code of Ordinances Chapter 18.  Thank you in advance for your attention to this very important matter!


Dead Tree Removal


Due to the increasing number of dead trees caused by the Ash Bore disease, Lanternflies, and other damages, property owners are responsible for the removal of dead trees on their property situated next to roads (in the right-of-way) before they become a safety hazard.


Lost and Found


Misplaced your keys or glasses on the Perkiomen Trail or maybe at the Upper Salford Park or Rahmer Park?  We may have them!  Our office has a small collection from over the past couple of years.  If you lost your keys or a jacket, stop by our office during normal business hours.

  Flood Information







CalendarFlood InformationStormwater ManagementSpring Mountain Ski AreaPhiladelphia Folk FestUpper Salford Library


A multi-year project to re-examine flood zones and develop detailed, digital flood hazard maps has been completed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The maps, also known as Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs), reflect current flood risks. You can visit FEMA’s online Map Service Center at msc.fema.gov for internet-accessible information about flood risk on a property-by-property basis. (When on that site, after you put in the address you are searching for, choose “Interactive Map” from the left side menu and that will show the Flood Hazard Zones.)
If you have any structure(s) located within the 100 year floodplain, it is suggested that you contact your insurance carrier as soon as possible to make sure you have sufficient coverage in the event that your property is damaged due to flooding.
For all available flood insurance options, visit the National Flood Insurance Program website at Flood Smart or call 1-888-379-9531.
Additional information is also available on the FEMA website, FEMA, or by calling 1-800-427-5593.
