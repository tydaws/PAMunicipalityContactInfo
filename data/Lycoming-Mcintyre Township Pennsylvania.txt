HARRISBURG, Pa. (WHTM) – March 7 was the deadline for candidates to file with the state to run in Pennsylvania’s 2023 primary election.
Statewide, the top-of-the-ticket race is for an open seat on the state Supreme Court with both Republicans and Democrats competing in contested primaries for the position.



		Who’s running for Supreme Court in Pennsylvania?	


On the Democratic side, two judges on the state Superior Court filed petitions to run. They are Daniel McCaffery, of Philadelphia, and Deborah Kunselman, of Beaver County. The Superior Court handles appeals from county courts in criminal and civil cases.
On the Republican side, Montgomery County’s president Judge, Carolyn Caluccio, filed, as did Commonwealth Court Judge Patricia McCullough. McCullough, of Allegheny County, also ran for state Supreme Court in 2021 and lost in the primary.

Candidates for Pennsylvania positions up for election could file their paperwork through 5 p.m. Tuesday, meaning more names may join the race the next day. Philadelphia weighs heavily Democratic, and the May 16 primary will likely determine who will be leading the city next.


  

A special election is also being held in the 163rd House District to replace Mike Zabel, who resigned after allegations of sexual harassment.
