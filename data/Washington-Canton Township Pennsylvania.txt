COVID-19 (Corona Virus) has received a lot of attention from the media.  COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by a novel (new) coronavirus that was first detected in China and which has now been detected in 65 locations internationally, including in the United States. The virus has been named “SARS-CoV-2” and the disease it causes has been named “coronavirus disease 2019” (abbreviated “COVID-19”). There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. However, as a reminder, CDC always recommends everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory diseases, including:•	Avoid close contact with people who are sick.•	Avoid shaking hands.•	Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth.•	Stay home when you are sick.•	Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.•	Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.•	Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.•	If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty.Useful links:https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/http://www.co.washington.pa.us/180/Public-Safetyhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.htmlhttps://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx
