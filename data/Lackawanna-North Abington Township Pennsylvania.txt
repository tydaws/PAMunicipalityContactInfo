For Your Safety: HOUSE NUMBERSThe  Township has assigned house numbers to all properties in the Township, not only for your convenience in having packages delivered - but for your safety!  In order for 911 Emergency to be able to locate your property, all residential and commercial buildings in the Township must visibly display the house number so that it can be seen from the street.   The numbers must be no smaller than 3" and should be reflective so the numbers can be seen at night.  In those cases when the numbers on the house cannot be read from the street due to distance, the numbers should be placed on a post or rural delivery mail box located adjacent to the driveway entrance.  Any questions regarding the placement of house numbers, please contact Tom Mundrake at roadmaster@northabingtontownship.org 


WAVERLY TOWNSHIP POLICE NEED YOUR HELPThe Waverly Township Police Department provides our residents with police protection, and a continuing issue requires your cooperation.  If you have a security system protecting your property, you must register certain information about the system with Waverly Township Police to enable them to contact you or another responsible person in your absence if your alarm system is triggered.  Sometimes the systems malfunction or an innocent event triggers the alarm.  It is important that the Waverly Police have information on file so that they can contact you immediately to discern the nature of the alarm.  Email us using the form below and enter "Alarm Registration" in the comment section, and we will email you the form.  Please promptly provide the completed form to the Waverly Police Department.
