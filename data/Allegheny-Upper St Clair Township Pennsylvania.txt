Code Enforcement






		  
          
  Code enforcement in Upper St. Clair ensures that the properties in the Township are maintained in a safe and code compliant manner. The Department of Planning and Community Development strives to effectively resolve property maintenance issues while remaining responsive to residents' questions.Upper St. Clair's Code Enforcement Officer is responsible for working with property owners explaining the Township regulations on vegetation growth, storage of materials and recreational vehicles, residence number identification, noise, litter and other related issues.These regulations, as adopted by the Board of Commissioners, are intended to protect the health, safety and welfare of the community and its residents. Click here to view a complete List of All Code Chapters in numerical order.Here are some frequently asked questions relating to code enforcement:



  











Can I park my recreational vehicle on my property?
The definition of a recreational vehicle is "a single-axle or multiple-axle non-self-propelled structure mounted on wheels or otherwise capable of being made mobile, and other types of vehicles, including but not limited to travel trailers, mobile homes, motor homes, tent trailers, boats, and boat trailers and horse trailers, and self-propelled motor homes, or campers; used for any purpose (for example commercial, residential, recreational); but not including a municipal or governmental purpose."The Township Code [Chapter 102] allows for parking of a recreational vehicle on a residential property for a period not to exceed ninety-six (96) hours. Beyond that, RVs should be stored in a garage or completely enclosed structure.It is suggested that if you are considering purchasing an RV, you find off site storage if you cannot accommodate storage on your property as required by the  Code.







Does the Township have a grass ordinance?
Brush, grass and weeds are addressed in Chapter 48 of the Code. Generally, grass is to be maintained at six inches or less between the months of April and October. Shrubbery and other growth which may cause sight distance hazards are also prohibited. 







Does the Township have a noise ordinance?
Yes, Chapter 89 of the Code addresses noise. However most people really want to know if the Township limits the hours of operation of heavy equipment. Permitted hours of operation for heavy equipment are Monday through Saturday, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.







I got a notice that my house numbers aren't in the correct place. What does the Code require?
In order for fire department, paramedic and police departments to find you during an emergency, the Township Code requires that house numbers be visible from the street and be Arabic numerals at least 4 inches high, clearly identifiable from the background on which they are mounted and in close proximity to the door facing the street. Supplemental numbers on mailboxes and the curb as well as script identification are permitted, however they cannot be substituted for numerals in proximity to the door facing the street. When a building is not visible from the street, the numbers should be placed on another part of the residence, clearly visible from the street, or in an alternate manner approved by the Township (Chapter 104 of the Township Code).







My neighbor has all kinds of junk stored on the side of his house. Is this allowed?
Chapter 80 of the Code  addresses junk and states that it is unlawful for any person to place or leave on any property in the Township any old scrapped or used appliances, fixtures, automobile parts, machinery or similar materials or discarded, unused or unusable materials which are unsightly. This includes unlicensed vehicles. An inspector will check the property and determine if the property is in compliance.







What are the requirements for the installation of a new mailbox or replacement of an existing mailbox?
Township Code Chapter 112, Article XIInstall mailboxes:

in front of and on the same side of the street as your residence
so that the bottom of the box is 3-1/2 feet to 4 feet above the cartway of the road
on a semiarch or extended arm-type of support assembly, which, if struck will bend or fall away from the striking vehicle instead of severely damaging the vehicle and injuring its occupants
so that the front of the mailbox is even with the back of the curb, edge of pavement or edge of paved berm, and the base of the support shall be at least 1 and 1/2 feet from the back of the curb, edge of pavement or edge of paved berm. Support assemblies shall not interfere with drainage facilities or sidewalks
to meet the minimum requirements of the U.S. Postal Service
