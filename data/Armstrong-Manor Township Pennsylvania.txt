On-Lot Sewage & Disposal System Information 

This information only applies to residents within Manor Township who have on lot systems. If you are on a public system, such as Lancaster City’s or LASA’s, please disregard.
To view the actual ordinance, click here.
Some FAQ’s are as follow:


Do I have to use your pumper/hauler? You must use a pumper/hauler approved by the Township.  They are listed on this webpage. There is no charge for them to be an approved pumper/hauler.


How often must I pump out? Everyone must pump out at least every 3 years. However, upon receiving notification, residents with only 3 people can opt to pump out every 4 years and residents with only 2 or less people can opt to pump out every 5 years.


Is there an additional cost for the Township to oversee this program? Yes. It is $5 and will be collected by the pumpers/haulers at the time of inspection.


If I was pumped out in the last 3 years, will that be when the clock starts or does it begin 1/1/2012? If you provide a manifest proving a pump out in the last 3 years, we will honor that as of the date of your last pump out.
