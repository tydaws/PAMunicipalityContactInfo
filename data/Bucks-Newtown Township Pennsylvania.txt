Township Board of SupervisorsNewtown Township2022-09-21T15:08:35-04:00

Newtown Township is a municipality of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The governing body is the five person, Board of Supervisors. Each Supervisor is elected for a six-year term. The Township operates under the “Second Class Township Code,” local ordinances and the Council-Manager form of organization. Newtown Township received designation from the International City/County Management Association (ICMA) in 1995 as a Recognized Local Government. The Board has adopted both the ICMA Code of Ethics and Mission Statement.
The Supervisors serve on a part-time basis. They enact Ordinances and Resolutions, issue Proclamations, approve land development plans and other land use applications, approve annual budgets and all expenditures, levy taxes, affirm hiring and termination of Township employees, make appointments to dozens of advisory boards, committees, commissions and task forces which serve the Township. The Supervisors elect their Chairman, Vice Chairman, Township Secretary and Township Treasurer from among their members at an annual reorganization meeting. The Township Manager and staff administer and operate the daily functions of government.
The Board meets on the second and fourth Wednesday
