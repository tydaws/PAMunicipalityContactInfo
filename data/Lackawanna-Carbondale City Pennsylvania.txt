Our History





Establishment
The Pioneer City was established in 1824 and incorporated on March 15, 1851




First Success
The D&H Gravity Railroad originated here in 1829. It became the first million dollar corporation in the United States.





A New Tradition
The very first St Patrick's Day Parade in the United States was here in 1833!  We recently started up that tradition again as a lighted parade each St. Patrick's Day.




A New City Hall
Carbondale's Majestic City Hall and Courthouse was built in 1894 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places




A Strange Visitor
In November of 1974 Carbondale was overrun by media and government agencies due to the report of a UFO landing in town. Allegedly a hoax, no UFO was found but the legend of the Carbondalien was born!




Family Fun Night
In 2003 Carbondale started their Pioneer Nights festival that showcased great local music, food, and all around family fun.  Pioneer Nights ends with a fireworks display and parade for the whole family to enjoy!
