Welcome To Moore Township


Moore Township was formed in 1765 and named after John Moore, a representative of the Provincial Assembly from 1761-1762. Moore Township is a large, rural community containing 38 square miles in north-central Northampton County, Pennsylvania. The Township entirely surrounds the small Borough of Chapman Quarries. Two larger boroughs, Bath and Nazareth, are located to the south and southeast. The township has 6 different mailing addresses due to its large size; they include Bath, Nazareth, Northampton, Danielsville, Walnutport and Wind Gap. 

The Moore Township Police Department and the Klecknersville Rangers Volunteer Fire Company provide 24 hour emergency services to the township. Moore Township is very rural and contains beautiful picturesque farmlands, woodlands and mountains. Framed to the north by the Blue Mountain, the Township has the famous Appalachian Trail, which runs through the Township. Agriculture and single-family residences, along with open space are the largest features that can be seen within the township. Despite the coming of the Industrial Age, Moore Township has remained largely rural in character.

In a series of meetings and questionnaires over the years, township residents said they value the physical beauty of the township, the openness of the land and the wildlife and plant life around them. Thus, in planning for the future they recognize the need to remember and preserve elements of the past.
