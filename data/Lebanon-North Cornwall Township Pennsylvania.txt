Stormwater Management Information




 










Many times the public hears the term Stormwater Management, MS4 or a combination of the two phrases. What does MS4 mean?

‘By definition an MS4 (Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System) is a system of conveyances that include, but are not limited to, catch basins, curbs, gutters, ditches, man-made channels, pipes, tunnels, and/or storm drains that discharge into Waters of the State.’

NCT Stormwater Ordinance (pdf)
North Cornwall Township participates in the Lebanon County Stormwater Consortium. Please click here for a brief overview of the Consortium, as well as the type of Projects funded by the Stormwater Management fee.
Annual Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) reports are available for public review at the Township office instead of on our website, due to the very large file size.
