Swift Reach


						(Emergency Notification System)
					

						In an effort to provide more reliable and effective communications with citizens, Chartiers Township has implemented Swiftreach Networks, Inc. as our emergency notification provider.
					

						Swift911™ is a system designed to make phone calls to specific people or areas in the event of an emergency or for sharing important information. Chartiers Township Emergency Management and other departments will use this system to notify citizens by phone of information regarding you or your property. The system can make thousands of calls in a minute to convey vital information. These messages may include information on floods, fires, water emergencies, road closures, missing persons, evacuation orders, and weather emergencies.
					

						 
					

						 
					

						 
					

						 
					

						 
					

						 
					

						 
					

						 
					

						 
					
 

							 
						

							 
						

							 
						

							 
						

							 
						

							 
						

							 
						

							The Swiftreach Network Data has been provided by a third party data provider and only includes listed phone numbers in Chartiers Township. It is important for residents and business owners to provide contact information such as unlisted, unpublished or cell phone numbers, which are often residents primary point of contact. Accurate numbers in the database help to ensure emergency information will be passed on to everyone in a timely manner.
						

							If you would like to provide an alternate number other than your home number you may also do so. The alternate phone number would be called if your primary phone number is not answered by a person or answering machine.
						

							All calls you receive will have the caller ID of “Chartiers Township.” Your information will not be provided to any outside agencies or companies.
