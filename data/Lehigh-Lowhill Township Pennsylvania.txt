Important Notice Regarding Open Burning In The Township
   
Spring is brush fire season in our region. Area fields are full of dry crop residue, wooded areas are covered in dry leaves and yards haven't turned green yet. The mixture of low humidity, high winds and plenty of available items on the ground to burn can make for a very dangerous situation. The Township monitors weather conditions daily and may place a temporary restriction on burning until conditions improve. Please be aware that while Spring is historically the most common time of year for burn bans, they can be enacted at any time as a result of drought or other weather related events.
    
Burn bans are enacted every time a Fire Danger Weather Related Warning is issued for our area by the National Weather Service. These notices include the following:

-Fire Weather Watch
-Enhanced Threats for Fire Spread
-Red Flag Warnings

Burn bans apply to all open fires! For more information regarding regulations for burning including acceptable items to burn, hours of burning, setbacks, etc. please review the Township's Burn Ordinance.
Ways that you can find out if a burn ban is in effect:

-Contact the Lehigh County 911 Center, Non-emergency # 610-437-5252
(Note: Per Twp. Ord. All open burns must be reported to the County 911 Center via this #)
-Contact the Township office at 610-285-6660 during normal business hours
-Sign-up for weather alerts from the National Weather Service. If an alert is issued related to fire weather in our Township then open burning is prohibited during the times specified in the alert.






Any resident who paid real estate tax without the fire tax added must contact carol betz @ 610-395-9142 as soon as possible to avoid having your money sent back. Partial payments can not be accepted.




     
It has come to our attention that our real estate bills were printed and mailed without the fire tax being added as a line item.  Please disregard the first bill received, a new bill has been issued and will be arriving within the next few business days.  Any questions, please call the Township office at 610-298-2641.  Thank you for your anticipated cooperation.

Welcome To Lowhill Township

Lowhill Township is located in Lehigh County, PA with a population of 2,173 at the 2010 census. We are a suburb of Allentown, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley region of the PA. It is drained by the Jordan Creek into the Lehigh River. Its villages include Claussville, Leather Corner Post, New Tripoli, Lyon Valley, and Weidasville. Route 100 crosses it from north to south.

Lowhill Township was established on the 18th day of December, 1753 in the Quarter Sessions Court of Northampton County. Lowhill Township was originally part of the territory that William Penn's sons purchased from the Lenni-Lenape tribe during the infamous Walking Purchase of 1737. Although Lowhill was initially designated part of Northampton County, the township was transferred over when Lehigh County was created in 1812.

A picturesque farming community replete with rolling hills and mineral-rich soil, the land was primarily settled by German immigrants who came to the area during the early part of the 18th Century. As a result, the German dialect known as Pennsylvania Dutch was the primary language of the area for nearly two hundred years, and was often taught in the one-room schoolhouses that operated in the area until the mid-1950s [read more].
