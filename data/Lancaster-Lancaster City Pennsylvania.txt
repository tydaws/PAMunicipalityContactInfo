Taxes & Fees FAQ
See below for more information about City of Lancaster property taxes and fees.
 
 
What taxes am I paying?
 
In the City of Lancaster, owners of real estate pay a property tax to the County, the City, and the School District. Each of these three taxing bodies has a different tax rate that is set by their respective elected officials. The County Commissioners set the tax rate for property taxes you pay to the County; the Mayor and City Council set the tax rate you pay to the City; and the School Board sets the rate for property taxes paid to the school district in which you live (School District of Lancaster, Conestoga Valley, or Lampeter-Strasburg).
 
 
How is my property tax calculated?
 
The amount of property tax you pay is based on the County’s assessed value of real estate property that you own. The assessed value of your property is NOT the same as the market value of your home. The market value is the value of your property if you were to sell it. In most cases, City properties are assessed at a value lower than the market value.
 
Property tax rates are calculated in mills and are based on millage rates set by the County Commissioners, Lancaster City Council, and the School Board of the School District of Lancaster. A mill is equal to $1 in taxation for every $1,000 of assessed value of your property.
 
 
2023 Millage Rates
 
– Lancaster County – 2.911 mills
– Lancaster City – 12.64 mills
– School District of Lancaster – 23.3531 mills (2022-2023 school year)
 
 
Does the City tax my income?
 
Yes. An Earned Income Tax (EIT) is levied on your income. The rate levied on City residents is 1.1 percent. Of this amount, 0.6 percent is paid to the City and 0.5 percent is paid to the school district in which you live (School District of Lancaster, Lampeter-Strasburg or Conestoga Valley). Your employer typically collects earned Income Taxes through a payroll deduction. Any questions regarding EIT collection, refunds, tax return filing, etc. should be directed to the Lancaster County Tax Collection Bureau 717-569-4521, or you can visit their website at www.lctcb.org.
 
 
Don’t I pay a tax for working in the City?
 
The Local Services Tax is charged on all persons who work in the City and earn more than $12,000 a year. The Local Services Tax is $52 per person, $47 of which is paid to the City and $5 of which is paid to the school district in which you live (School District of Lancaster, Lampeter-Strasburg or Conestoga Valley). You pay the Local Services Tax to the City if you are employed in the City, regardless of where you live. Any questions regarding EIT collection, refunds, tax return filing, etc. should be directed to the LCTCB at 717-569-4521 or you can visit their website at www.lctcb.org.
 
 
Can I pay my taxes online? Can I make credit card payments?
 
Yes. You can pay City Real Estate Taxes at our secure website by clicking the Pay Online Link. Please note that online payments include a small convenience fee. City Real Estate tax payment methods are as follows: mail a check to the Treasury Office, payments can be dropped in the drop box located outside the Treasury door, check, money order or cash payments can be made in the Treasury Office, or pay with a credit card or e-check on the City’s secure website( small convenience fee applies). Please note- any checks that are returned for NSF (non-sufficient funds) reason(s), an additional $50.00 charge will be added to the account.
 
 
Are there any tax or rent rebate programs that I should know about?
 
If you earn less than $12,000 a year, you may be eligible for a rebate of the full amount you paid for the Local Services Tax. To apply for this rebate, contact the Lancaster County Tax Collection Bureau at 717-569-4521 or you can visit their website at www.lctcb.org.
 
Also, many older adults on a fixed income are eligible to apply for Pennsylvania’s Tax and Rent Rebate program. The Property Tax/Rent Rebate program benefits eligible Pennsylvanians age 65 and older; widows and widowers age 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. Eligible applicants can be reimbursed up to $650 for the amount they paid in property taxes or rent. To apply for this rebate, visit www.revenue.state.pa.us/ptrr.
 
Eligible Pennsylvanians can sign up to have Property Tax Rebate/Rent Rebate forms mailed to them or may sign up online at www.state.pa.us, or call toll-free (888) 222-9190.

Bureau of Property Maintenance and Housing Inspections
The Bureau of Property Maintenance and Housing Inspections is responsible for ensuring safe and quality housing stock through the administration of the City of Lancaster’s Property Maintenance and Rental Property Ordinances.
 
Our Housing Inspectors
Are Certified Code officials of International Property Maintenance (IPMC) which provides requirements for continued use and maintenance of building elements, site conditions, swimming pools, plumbing, mechanical, electrical and fire protection systems in existing residential and nonresidential structures.
 
What We Do
The Bureau is committed to working with residents, tenants, property owners, landlords, and community organizations to educate the public on maintaining their properties.
 
How
Pursuant to City Ordinance Chapter 238 Rental Property, and Chapter 223 Property Maintenance, and Chapter 182 Lead Poisoning Prevention & Lead Hazard Control, the City of Lancaster has established a Residential Rental Property Program.
 
Purpose
Promote public health, safety and welfare by establishing accountability for the proper maintenance of residential rental housing units through a license and registration program and a systematic inspection process. Regular inspections of rental properties are conducted to ensure safety and maintain quality of life standards.
 
When
 
The City will systematically inspect all residential rental properties no less frequently than every six years as set forth in the policies and procedures. Systematic inspections are scheduled 90 days in advance.
We conduct complaint based inspections when notified through the Housing Hotline at (717) 291-4706 or email pmhi@cityoflancasterpa.gov to report property maintenance violations.
 
For violations related to grass and weeds, trash, or snow removal, please contact the SWEEPS hotline at (717) 291-4744 or email SWHotline@cityoflancasterpa.gov
 
Lead Safety
The Bureau of Property Maintenance & Housing Inspections will inspect approximately 12,000 rental properties built prior to 1978 over a four-year cycle for possible lead hazards during the systematic inspection process to minimize lead hazards within the city’s housing stock.
 
New requirements go into effect January 2023. The new ordinance enhances lead safety protections in rental housing and childcare facilities. This ordinance requires all rental properties and childcare facilities built before 1978 to meet lead safety requirements every two to four years. Learn more at cityoflancasterpa.gov/lead-safe.

Parking, Street Cleaning & Snow Removal








PARKING
The City of Lancaster has a number of parking options for residents, commuters and visitors. See below for more information about parking options, residential permit parking, street cleaning, snow removal, how to pay parking tickets and more.
 
Garages and lots are managed by the Lancaster Parking Authority. Metered parking, street cleaning and residential permit parking is enforced by the Lancaster Parking Authority. Parking tickets are paid through the Lancaster Parking Authority.
 
 
STREET CLEANING
Street cleaning is either weekly or bi-weekly, depending on the route. The City of Lancaster is federally mandated to provide street cleaning year round in order to keep litter out of storm drains. Litter that ends up in a storm drain then goes into our combined sewer system, which has the potential to empty into our waterways and ultimately end up in the Chesapeake Bay. Please help us keep our water safe by paying attention to street cleaning signage when you parking and moving your car when necessary.
 
There will be no street cleaning on the following days:
 
New Year’s Day
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day
Washington’s Birthday (Presidents Day)
Good Friday
Memorial Day
Independence Day
Labor Day
Election Day
Thanksgiving & the day after
Christmas & the day after (Observed Monday, December 26, 2022 and Tuesday, December 27, 2022)
 
Street cleaning maintains a regular schedule year-round except for times when suspended due to holidays or extreme weather. Cancellations will be communicated via our website, social media, text message alerts and email. Utilizing the street cleaning schedule even when snow remains on the ground allows the Department of Public Works to continue to clear travel and parking lanes from snow, as well as normal street cleaning debris. This work ensures access to safe travel and accessible parking for all residents.
 
 
SNOW REMOVAL
The City of Lancaster provides snow removal on public streets during winter weather events. During light snow, cars can remain parked on the street. Typically, when there is a strong forecast for 8 or more inches of snow, the City will declare a Snow Emergency. Declaration of a Snow Emergency allows the Department of Public Works and the Police Bureau to restore reasonable flow of traffic in the City as quickly and effectively as possible. Whenever possible, streets will be plowed curb to curb.
 
Cars parked along snow emergency routes must be moved within one hour of the declaration of a Snow Emergency. Failure to remove a vehicle from a Snow Emergency Route could result in a parking ticket or towing of the vehicle at the owner’s expense.
 
During a Snow Emergency, the City will advise the public through local media, the City website and social media outlets, Everbridge Alerts, text message alerts and email.

CLEARING SIDEWALKS
Property owners are required to clear their sidewalks and the openings to any crosswalks of snow and ice within five hours of the end of the snow. If the snow ends overnight, the property owner has until 10 a.m.
 
Do not throw or blow snow into the street when cleaning off your vehicles or sidewalks after the snow plow has gone through. Please pile the snow in grassy areas and along the curb. We understand that this can be difficult during large snowfalls, and appreciate your good-faith effort to keep snow out of the streets while clearing your sidewalks!
 
Please be considerate of your neighbors. Have a neighbor who’s not home, elderly or handicapped? Please take some time and help them out with this task.
 
If you need assistance with snow removal, consider reaching out for a volunteer through Dig Out Lancaster County, a private Facebook group. Go to www.facebook.com/groups/DiggingOutLancasterCounty for more information.
 
If there is a fire hydrant or storm drain adjacent to your property, please clear it.
 
If you have an issue with a property that has not cleared snow or ice within the allotted time frame, you can report the address to Housing at (717) 291-4706 or housing@cityoflancasterpa.gov.
