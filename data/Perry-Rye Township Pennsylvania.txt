Welcome to Rye Township


Located in Perry County west of Marysville and the Susquehanna River, in the Fishing Creek Valley between Cove and Blue Mountains, Rye Township retains most of the rural character it has had since its creation by political subdivision in 1766.  (Click on the History link at the top of the page for more information.)
While broad fields and vast woods still dominate our valley, early local industry such as grist and lumber mills have given way to the homes of commuters who work in the state capital of Harrisburg- a short distance to the south across the Susquehanna River.
Rye Township is the third oldest Township in Perry County and celebrated its 250th Birthday in the year 2016. When first created, in 1766, Rye was a part of Cumberland County because at that time Perry County did not even exist. Perry County was created in 1820.
We extend a special thank you to all the past and present officials and all the volunteers and residents who have given or are currently giving of their time and abilities to help make and keep Rye Township, Perry County a great place to live.
