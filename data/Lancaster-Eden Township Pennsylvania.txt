Eden Township began its life in 1691 as part of Old Sadsbury Township in Chester County.  Later when Lancaster County was formed, Old Sadsbury divided in two with half staying in Chester County & the other half becoming part of the newly formed Lancaster County.  Renamed Sadsbury Township, it was the first settled & organized township in Lancaster.

In 1744 Bart Township broke off of Sadsbury taking the areas that would eventually be both Eden Township & Quarryville Village with it.   

In 1855 Eden Township (with Quarryville still part of its area) was officially established.  The township, which took its name from the
furnace at Mt. Eden, had soil rich in limestone, a picturesque landscape, & highly productive mills.  These characteristics have led many to erroneously think the township was named after the "Garden of Eden".

In 1892 Quarryville was officially chartered as a Borough making it a separate entity from Eden Township.

Today Eden Township’s beauty & productive agricultural environment make it an  important part of Lancaster County’s past & future.© Eden Township 2016-2017
