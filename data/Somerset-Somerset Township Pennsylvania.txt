2023 Spring Clean Up
04/13/2023 - 05/04/2023

PRESS RELEASE
 
 Somerset Township is announcing Spring Clean Up 2023. This year’s clean-up will be held May 1ST -May 4TH 2023. All Somerset Township Residents will be required to bring bulky waste items to the Somerset Township Municipal Building, 2209 N. Center Avenue, Somerset, and dispose items into the Roll-Off Containers from the hours of 6 a.m.-8 p.m. A high lift will be on site to help residents to place items in the containers. Somerset Township is waving fees; however, Somerset Township Residents MUST provide proof of residency—driver’s license and/or current utility bill.
E-Waste (Electronics) will be accepted on April 29, 2023 ONLY from 8:00 AM – Noon. Tires WILL NOT be accepted at this year’s clean up. Somerset Township is recommending that residents take tires to a local tire dealership. 
In cooperation with Somerset Township 2023 Spring Clean Up the Somerset Township Supervisors would like to encourage Township Residents to help reduce litter by forming small groups to clean up Somerset Township roads, streams etc.
As we see increased trash around Somerset Township we are encouraging residents to start litter cleanup events in their neighborhoods to help keep Somerset Township Green.  This is as simple as heading outdoors with a small group of family, friends, co-workers and club members and bagging up trash.  Even a small event makes an immediate impact.
Somerset Township is asking all individuals involved with the Clean-Up to contact the Township at 814-445-4675 and identify the area of clean-up and the location of the bags to arrange pick up by Township employees.
All volunteers will be recognized for their clean- up efforts.
