National Police Week 2023  - Sunday, May 14, 2023For generations, courageous men and women of our Nation’s law enforcement community have dedicated their lives to protecting us in big cities, small towns, and suburban neighborhoods across America.  Each morning, police officers pin on their shield and walk out the door to go to work, hoping they will come home safely.  Last year, a record number of law enforcement officers died in the line of duty.  On Peace Officers Memorial Day and during Police Week, we express our gratitude for these selfless public servants who put themselves in harm’s way to keep us safe and honor those who lost their lives in the line of duty. 
During Police Week, let us demonstrate our appreciation for the unsung heroes who nobly wear the badge and put their lives at risk to protect people each and every day.  Let us honor the brave officers whose bright futures were cut short in the line of duty.  Let us come together to help police be the partners and protectors our communities and our Nation need for a safer, more just America.
The Board of Supervisors and other Management Staff would like to personally thank the dedicated Officers of Hemlock Township for the service provided to our businesses and residents.  Be Stormwater Smart - Monday, September 26, 2022Urban stormwater runoff pollution is a problem that has no boundaries, and neither does the solution! While the DEP Bureau of Clean Water works with counties, towns and other municipalities, construction firms, and industries to help them follow regulations to reduce stormwater runoff, Pennsylvania residents can also do their part to reduce stormwater runoff. read more ...LIBRARY PRIVILEGES - Wednesday, August 10, 2016Did You Know?...As a resident of Hemlock Township, you are entitled to free library privileges at the Bloomsburg Public Library! read more ...
