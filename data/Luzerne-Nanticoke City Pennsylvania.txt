You are due a refund,
You filed on paper more than 6¬†months ago, and
Where‚Äôs My Refund¬†does not show that¬†we received your return.

Resubmit your tax return only if all of the items above apply to you.

& COAT OF ARMS
¬†
The Motto and Coat of Arms for Nanticoke was created and designed by retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Winiarczyk, then redesigned by Richard Crossett of Louisville, Ky.
Upon recommendation of the Nanticoke Bicentennial Committee, the Motto and Coat of Arms was adopted by Nanticoke City Council on May 17, 1976 as the city's official Motto and Coat of Arms.

The arrow head on the shield symbolizes the Nanticoke Indians. The diamond shapes represent the surrounding mountains and anthracite coal in the area.Above the shield is the city name, and above that is a wreath of the state flower, Mountain Laurel, which indicates that Nanticoke is a city in Pennsylvania.Within the Mountain Laurel is a forearm, which symbolizes the industry and vigor of the people of the city. The hand is holding a banner that suggests the unity of the many ethnic groups and nationalities of the inhabitants of the city through the years.
The Motto is "Forward Together," which denotes the unity and true aspirations of the citizens of Nanticoke.Famous Nanticokians
