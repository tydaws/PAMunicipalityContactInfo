Warwick Emergency Services CommissionMission statement:
To promote and ensure the present and future vitality of our region’s volunteer emergency response organizations.
This Warwick Emergency Services Alliance (WESA) was established in 2001 with 10 member organizations. This was a partnership of local government and volunteer emergency service providers dedicated to the continued support and success of the volunteer community for the region it represents. In the summer of 2013, the partner municipalities of the Warwick Emergency Services Alliance adopted an Amended and Restated Intermunicipal Agreement that created a commission of individuals representing each of the emergency services providers and the municipalities. This newly created organization is the Warwick Emergency Services Commission (WESC). The members continue to promote and ensure the present and future vitality of our region’s volunteer emergency response organizations.
The WESC Board of Directors is composed of 8 voting members consisting of 1 member of the governing body of each Municipality, 1 member from each Fire Company, 1 member of Warwick Community Ambulance Association, and 1 citizen at large (to be rotated by municipality each year). The Director is a nonvoting member of the WESC Board of Directors.

About Elizabeth Township
Our HistoryElizabeth Township possesses a rich historical heritage. Established in 1757 from what was then Warwick Township, it was split again in 1853 to create the present Clay Township to the east.
The area now comprising Elizabeth Township played an important part in the development of the County in early colonial days. The village of Brickerville dates from 1741, when the area’s first blast furnace was built to make cast iron from ore from the Cornwall mines. Stiegel glass manufacturing, dating from 1757, soon grew into an international export. Iron production grew, reaching its peak about 1780 and continuing until 1856. The supplying of charcoal from area forests to feed the furnaces over this period became an important related industry.
Today, Elizabeth Township is a quiet rural community, devoted largely to agricultural, recreational and residential uses. The Township’s largest village is Brickerville. Some other smaller villages include Elm, Poplar Grove and Lexington.
The Organization
About UsBoard of SupervisorsElizabeth Township is a Second Class Township governed by a three-member Board of Supervisors who are elected by the qualified voters of the Township for terms of six years each. Their responsibilities include setting of policy, approval of expenditures, budgets, zoning amendments, care of roads and bridges, hiring of personnel and appointing members to various boards and commissions.
AuditorsThe Board of Auditors meets annually to audit Township accounts and set wages for Township Supervisors who are employed by the Township. The Auditors are elected by the qualified voters of the Township to serve six-year terms.
Zoning Hearing BoardThe three members of the Elizabeth Township Zoning Hearing Board must be residents of the Township and are appointed by the Board of Supervisors to serve three-year terms. Provisions for special exceptions or variances from the Zoning Ordinance are administered by the Zoning Hearing Board.
Planning CommissionThe Planning Commission consists of seven Township residents appointed by the Board of Supervisors to serve four-year terms. The Planning Commission reviews subdivision and land development plans and provides recommendations and comments to the Board of Supervisors and Lancaster County Planning Commission.
