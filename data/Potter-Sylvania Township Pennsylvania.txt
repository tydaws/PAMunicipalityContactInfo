BRUSH PICKUP 
Track where crews are/have been by utilizing our grid tracker.
The Road Department offers a semi-annual Brush Pickup for Township residents. Spring brush pickup will begin on April 17, 2023 (COMPELTE).   Fall brush pickup begins September 11.
Each Pickup is a “one (1) time only” pickup. This service consists of removing piles of storm-damaged brush and leaves, such as branches and tree limbs, this service does not include tree removal. Therefore, we request all residents to place their storm-damaged brush and leaves along the edge of the roadway in separate piles before the scheduled pickup. Do not place piles in the roadway or gutter area. We service over 174 miles of roadway which requires several days to complete the pickup.

Tree Removal, lot clearing, and grass clippings material are prohibited. Brush should not exceed 6 feet in length and 6 inches in diameter.

Please Note: Private Recycling Facilities are available at the following locations:

Clean Wood Recycling, 419-843-9663, 6505 West Bancroft Street, between Interstate I-475 and McCord Road.
A&J Landscape, 419-842-8733, 8061 Sylvania Avenue, between King Road and Centennial Road.

The Fall Season Leaf Pickup starts Monday, October 16, and is performed on a patrol basis. During peak times one cycle through the Township requires 17(+/-) days. Depending on weather conditions, our goal is to perform at least three (3) pickup cycles.  Leaves should be placed at the curbside or along the edge of the street, free of brush and garden waste allowing our crews to work efficiently.  Crews are unable to pick up leaves mixed with brush and other items. Place your leaves away from obstacles such as mailboxes, fire hydrants, landscaping timbers, and landscaping rocks. These obstacles can cause injury to our employees, and equipment, and reduce efficiency.
PLEASE DO NOT PLACE LEAVES IN THE STREET OR IN PLASTIC BAGS.

Leaf Pickup Facts:
The Township’s leaf pickup program services 138.23 miles of residential roads, 30.81 miles of County roads, 10.29 miles of State Highways, and 3.51 miles of Interstate miles, all totaling 182.84 miles of roadways. Our community’s landscape consists of largely wooded areas. (Sylvania is Latin for “Wooded Area”)
These trees are very beautiful and a true nature’s jewel, until the leaves drop and fall to the ground. Unfortunately, Mother Nature decides when the leaves fall, and some years the leaves drop late in the season and all at once. The “softwood” trees drop their leaves the earliest. As the leaves fall, the Road Department devotes its entire staff to operating 5 crews during the leaf pickup season.
Each crew consists of two (2) full-time employees and one (1) or two (2) part-time/temporary employees. Early snowfalls and above-average rain are two factors that spell trouble for leaf pickup. These attributes cause the leaves to become saturated and “heavy” to pick up, thus causing inefficiencies. Our preferred and most efficient method of picking up leaves is utilizing the “vacuum tow behind” type of equipment. Recently, we hired private contractors with front loader buckets and dump trucks to assist our leaf pickup efforts. We are aware that it is frustrating waiting for your neighborhood pickup and appreciate your patience.

SNOW PLOWING
To report a street that has been missed by the snowplow operator, please call the following:
During business hours: 419-882-0031, extension 1503
After business hours: Police Dispatcher 419-882-2055
Sylvania Township Road Department’s top priorities in a snowstorm are plowing Township roadways and clearing fire department & police station parking lots, which may require several trips along the same route.
Snow plowed from roadways may end up blocking residential driveways. We recognize the inconvenience, however, due to the nature of clearing snow-covered roadways; we plow snow to the curbside of the street.
To reduce the amount of snow that might block your driveway, shovel an open area along the shoulder at the entrance (see illustration below). Plow blades will then push snow into the area just before your driveway, leaving a much smaller amount in front it.
Please heed the snow advisories and other warnings issued by the Township, county, or state agencies.
Remember bridges and ramps freeze first and may be especially difficult to navigate.
Never pass a snowplow or salt truck, especially a plow train! Plow trains are groups of trucks that form a line across the lanes to clear snow. Operators may not see you or your car may get caught on a snow-covered plow edge. In addition, driving will be much easier if you stay at least 25 feet, or three car lengths, behind the snow emergency vehicle.
Do not abandon your vehicle. The safest place to wait for help is in your car. If your car breaks down, move your vehicle as far off the roadway as possible and lift the hood. Try to leave a distress signal, such as a scarf, hanging from the window. Please remember, when you abandon your vehicle, it may be subject to towing, ticketing, and/or a fine.
Remember, when shoveling snow from your driveway; create a pile away from the roadway. A good rule is to shovel to the right when facing the street. However, keep in mind that the important thing is not to shovel the snow onto an area that will simply be plowed back onto the driveway when the state, county, or Township snowplows come through.

FUND ACCOUNTING 
The Township uses fund accounting to maintain its financial records. Each fund serves as an accounting entity with a self balancing set of accounts that are used to segregate resources that are restricted for a specific use. We currently maintain 23 Funds. Four of our major funds include the General Fund, Road & Bridge Fund, Police Fund and Fire Fund.

The General Fund is used to account for all financial resources other than what is restricted to be accounted for in another fund. The General Fund is the only fund that can be used for any purpose provided that expenses and transfers are followed according to the laws prescribed by the State of Ohio. Unlike the other three major funds, property tax revenue represents about 27% of the estimated revenue to be received for this fund. Other sources of revenue include cable franchise fees, inheritance/estate taxes and intergovernmental funding that is allocated from the State of Ohio and Lucas County for operational uses. There are fees and misc revenue that are receipted into the General Fund but they are minimal and vary from year to year.

The Road and Bridge Fund is used to account for the resources that are restricted  for the purpose of construction, repair and maintenance of roads, storm sewers and ditches located within the township as well as the operational expenses of this department. Property taxes represent 96% of the estimated revenue to be received for this fund. There are fees and misc revenue that are receipted into the Road & Bridge Fund but they are minimal and vary from year to year. The Road Department has access to other revenue sources that can be used for specific purposes such as to repair, maintain and construct the roadways; this revenue is accounted for in three separate funds; The Motor Vehicle License Tax Fund, The Gasoline Tax Fund and The Permissive Motor Vehicle License Tax Fund. Operational expenses are not allowed to be expended from these funds. The motor vehicle license tax and permissive motor vehicle license tax revenue are derived from various fees imposed by the state upon owners of motor vehicles. The revenue received from these fees are collected and credited to the state’s auto registration distribution fund. The state creates an account for each county and district of registration, including townships from which various defined percentages are distributed to the local governments based on the percentage of the total number of miles of road that are located within their jurisdiction, which they maintain. The proceeds from both taxes must be used for highways, roads, streets and bridges. The proceeds from the gasoline tax are received from the County. Currently there is a twenty-eight cent per gallon tax on motor vehicle fuel. The twenty-eight cents is derived from five different levies that have been enacted over the years. Townships receive 1.9 cents or 6.8% of these proceeds. Distributions are made from the Ohio Department of Taxation to the County. The county then pays the townships according to the number of miles of roadway in each jurisdiction. These proceeds are restricted by the Ohio Constitution and state law and can only be used to construct, repair and maintain public roads as well.

The Police fund is used to account for resources that are restricted for the purpose of law enforcement and public safety related expenses. Property taxes represent 97% of the estimated revenue to be collected for this fund. Other sources of revenue include intergovernmental funding that is allocated from the State of Ohio and Lucas County for operational uses. There are fees and misc revenue that are receipted into the Police Fund but they are minimal and vary from year to year. The Police Department also has access to four other funds in which they receive revenue that can be used to purchase items such as equipment and supplies. One fund is used to account for grants and donations: this revenue is used for various expenses such as reimbursement to the department for salaries of DARE Officers, it enables them to purchase educational items for DARE, Safety Township and the Safety Belt Program that are taught in our elementary and junior high schools. The other three funds consist of the Drug Law Enforcement Fund, the Law Enforcement Trust Fund and the Federal Law Enforcement Trust Fund. Revenue received in these funds are not used for operational expenses, the allowable uses are restricted by state or federal law. The revenue received in the Drug Law Enforcement Fund comes from a percentage of drug related fines collected from cases that are heard in the Sylvania Municipal Court. The revenue received in the Law Enforcement Trust and the Federal Law Enforcement Funds are based on a percentage of proceeds from seized and forfeited property that were acquired in drug related arrests that are heard in state or federal court. The township receives this money because we have officers that are assigned to a special task force outside of our jurisdiction.

The Fire Fund is used to account for resources that are restricted for the purpose Fire protection and emergency services. Property taxes represent 86% of the estimated revenue to be collected for this fund. Other sources of revenue include intergovernmental funding that is allocated from the State of Ohio and Lucas County for operational uses. There are fees and misc revenue that are receipted into the Fire Fund but they are minimal and vary from year to year. The only other source of funding available to the Fire Department is their grants and donations which are accounted for in a separate fund. This revenue is used for various expenses such as tools, equipment, medical supplies and enables them to purchase awareness and educational items for various fire safety programs that are taught in our elementary and junior high schools and throughout our community. The allowable uses for the grants are restricted by state and federal laws.
