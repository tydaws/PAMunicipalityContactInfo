Permits Overview		





Permit Portal
 
 
 
 





SUBMIT YOUR PERMIT ONLINE* (Permit Portal) - The permit portal adds you to the queue faster, and allows for online payments. HOWEVER, a completed and signed application still needs to be uploaded to the portal or submitted to the Township in person or emailed to easttown@easttown.org. Unsure if your permit application is complete? Use the Application Completeness Checklist.



 
 
 





PLEASE BE ADVISED: Permitting forms have been updated for 2023.  Applications revised prior to December 2022 will NOT be accepted. Additionally, permitting fees were updated in the most recent Easttown Township Fee Schedule.Prior to starting any work, the property owner or contractor must obtain the appropriate permits and forms from the township for the proposed project. Please also note that it is the responsibility of the applicant to become familiar and comply with all Township Ordinances, including but not limited to the Zoning Ordinance, the Subdivision & Land Development Ordinance, the Natural Resources Protection Ordinance and the Stormwater Management Ordinance.
