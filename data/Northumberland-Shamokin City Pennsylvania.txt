WHAT IS A PSD CODE?

PSD Codes (political subdivision codes) are six-digit numbers that uniquely identify each municipality, township, borough, and city in Pennsylvania. PSD Codes play an integral role in assisting employers and tax collectors to remit and distribute the correct amount of local Earned Income Tax to the correct taxing jurisdictions.



																	The first TWO (2) digits of a PSD 
																	Code represent the Tax Collection 
																	District (TCD) - in most cases, the 
																	county in which the address is 
																	located.
																



																	In combination, the first FOUR (4) 
																	digits of a PSD Code represent the 
																	School District (SD) in which the 
																	address is located.
																



																	In combination, all SIX (6) digits 
																	of a PSD Code represent the 
																	political subdivision (PSD), township, 
																	borough, or city in which the address 
																	is located.

Access Issue: Privately owned
            Details

                Information found on DCNR State PA web site implies this is privately owned and is considered to be a scientific, educational, scenic, and historical, site currently has open access   readinganthracite.com/whale….
            




        Description
         


Whaleback Mountain is a large shale rock formation, that exhibits stages of deformation and folds that looks like a graint whaleback. The local educational systems uses this site for Geology field trips.   There are currently about 15 established routes at the Whaleback. All of the cracks have been climbed. Some runout face climbs exist between the cracks as well.






        Getting There
         


Whaleback is located in Shamokin, PA off a dead-end road called Bear Valley Avenue. Drive down this road until it changes to dirt and then it gets rough and goes up hill; some may want to park at that point. However if you drive carefully as I did you can make it all the way without four wheel drive.  Once at the top of the hill the dirt road gets wider look to your left you should see the Whaleback. Stop and park here and look for a dirt bike trail heading down hill towards the rock formation. Follow the trail to the base of the rock.

WHAT IS 
							A PSD CODE?PSD Codes (political subdivision codes) are six-digit numbers that uniquely identify each municipality, township, borough, and city in Pennsylvania. PSD Codes play an integral role in assisting employers and tax collectors to remit and distribute the correct amount of local Earned Income Tax to the correct taxing jurisdictions. 

							Shamokin City's PSD Code is 490-403. Make sure it is 
							on your paycheck!
Employees are required to complete a Residency Certification Form upon hire (and with any subsequent change in address) in order to confirm the PSD Codes and EIT Rates being used by the employer for the employees' local taxing purposes. Employers maintain this form in the employees' personnel files.


											The first TWO (2) digits of a PSD 
											Code represent the Tax Collection 
											District (TCD); in most cases, the 
											county in which the address is 
											located.


											In combination, the first FOUR (4) 
											digits of a PSD Code represent the 
											School District (SD) in which the 
											address is located.


											In combination, all SIX (6) digits 
											of a PSD Code represent the 
											political subdivision (PSD); the township, 
											borough, city in which the address 
											is located.
