Township History


 



                The history of the township was compiled and printed in 1977 by a committee consisting of Orvis Anderson, Louis Haun, 
                Larry Kitch, and Stanley Stewart. Following are excerpts from the history book:




                South Pymatuning, the only new township in the past one hundred twenty years of Mercer County history, was formed from
                Pymatuning Township by a court decree dated December 7, 1914.




                The area of our township was included in the following larger areas before our county was formed in 1800: first Northwest
                Territory of Pennsylvania, then Westmoreland County, later Allegheny County, and finally Mercer County in 1800. The 
                northwest section of Mercer County was first called Salem Township. Then in 1806 the southern part became Pymatuning 
                Township, from which our township was formed in 1914.




                The size of the township as stated by the court decree remained unchanged until after 1950, when the United States 
                Government started to acquire land for the construction of the Shenango Reservoir. Of the 15,000 acres of land purchased 
                by the U.S. Government for the Shenango Reservoir Area, South Pymatuning Township lost a larger portion than any other 
                political unit. In addition to the land acquired by the federal government, the entire southeast section of the township 
                lying south and east of Clarksville was annexed by the Borough of Clark in 1960.




                There are a number of reasons to believe that the area of South Pymatuning Township had an extensive Indian habitation.
                Many artifacts, the stone weapons and tools of the Indians, have been collected in this area since the coming of the early 
                settlers.

                South Pymatuning Township now has a Safe Medication Disposal box in the Municipal Building lobby where residents may dispose of expired and unused prescription drugs and over the counter medications.

COVID-19 isn’t going away.  
As life goes on, we can take steps to protect ourselves and our loved ones from illness.  
Pennsylvanians ages 6 months and older are eligible for the COVID vaccine, and Pennsylvanians ages 5 and older are eligible to schedule a booster.
Here are resources to help individuals, families, and businesses follow safety guidance and get vaccinated.

Track Pennsylvania’s Progress

Why Vaccines?
Vaccines are the best way to protect against serious illnesses.
COVID-19 vaccination will help protect you by creating an antibody response without having to experience sickness.
Why Boosters?
Boosters increase protection against COVID-19. Studies show boosters further keep you from experiencing serious illness from COVID.
If you got doses of the Pfizer and Moderna, you can get a booster dose if it has been at least five months since the initial series of two doses.
Individuals who received the Johnson & Johnson (Janssen) vaccine are eligible to get a booster if it has been at least two months since your initial dose.
What If I’ve Already Had COVID?
Because experts don’t know how long immunity lasts after someone get sick with COVID-19, vaccines still offer important protection to Pennsylvanians who have already had COVID.
How Much Do Vaccines Cost?
Vaccine doses purchased with American dollars will be provided by the federal government at no cost.

COVID-19 in PennsylvaniaThe expiration of the federal Public Health Emergency (PHE) declaration does not mean the virus is gone. The best defense against COVID-19 remains getting vaccinated and continuing basic health and hygiene practices, like handwashing, staying home when sick and avoiding contact with people who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19. The CDC will continue to keep track of variants; you can find the latest information here.After May 11, 2023, when the PHE expired, much of the COVID-19 data states have been collecting will no longer be mandated to be reportable to the Department of Health, therefore data shared on this site going forward will not be as comprehensive as it was since the start of the pandemic Everyone over the age of 6 months is encouraged get vaccinated.
