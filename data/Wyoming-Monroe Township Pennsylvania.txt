TIPS FOR FILING LOCAL EARNED INCOME TAX
The Earned Income Tax is collected by the Cumberland County Tax Bureau located at 12 Waterford Drive, just west of the high school. Here are some tips for filing your return and some additional information about the Bureau.
File as soon as you can AND file online at www.cumberlandtax.org. Staff members at the Bureau can assist you in this process. If you file online, have a balance due, and pay by check, use the coupon that is produced and mail it with your check. Your check will be processed immediately.
If you file a paper return, also file as soon as you can (January or February). This is important if you have a balance due and pay by check, because your check will be processed quickly. If you wait until mid-March or later, when the bulk of returns are filed, the processing time for your check will be longer.
Lobby counter hours at the Bureau are Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM to 4:30 PM. There are additional hours during tax week and those hours are available on the web site. Bureau staff will help prepare your return without an appointment and at no cost during these hours.
