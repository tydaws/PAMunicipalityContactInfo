Administrative Office Update
At a recent meeting of the Franconia Township Board of Supervisors, a group of residents asked the Board to investigate allegations of easy access to age-inappropriate materials available to young children at the Indian Valley Public Library.Â  The Board received these allegations and indicated to those residents that the Township would look into the matter.
Â Since that time, there appears to be erroneous information circulating on social media and throughout the Township about defunding the Library.Â  The Board of Supervisors would like to be clear - there have been no discussions from the Board to defund the Library.Â  In addition, the Township has not asked the Library to ban any books.
Â Instead, at this point, the Township is still in an information-gathering stage.Â  The Township has been performing due diligence on this issue and has requested that the Library provide its procedures and processes around what media is available to whom, and where it is stored.Â  The Library has asked for some time to gather that information and will report it back to the Board.
Â 
The Franconia Township Board of Supervisors is made up of residents of the Township who are parents and grandparents who take both parental rights and the protections of the first amendment seriously.Â  They want to be sure that they fully understand the issue before responding to the residents who brought the complaint.
THE TOWNSHIP IS NOW ACCEPTING IN-PERSON PAVILION RENTAL RESERVATIONS FOR 2023. PLEASE NOTE RENTAL FEES AT SECTION 10 OF THE ATTACHED RESOLUTION NO. 21-17-20-12 (FOUND BELOW).Â 
PERMIT APPLICATIONS can be found on this website on the Building and Zoning page or complete packets can be picked up in the office.
The completed application can be mailed, placed in the drop box at the entrance to the Township Building or be given to an office staff member between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.Â Â
