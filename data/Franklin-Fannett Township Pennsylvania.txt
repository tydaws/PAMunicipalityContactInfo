Franklin County is reminding residents to follow recommendations from the PADOH and local healthcare providers:


Avoid contact with people who are sick.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

Wear a mask.

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds (say the Pledge of Allegiance twice or sing “Happy Birthday” twice).

Use an alcohol- based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.

Cover any coughs or sneezes with your elbow, not your hands.

Clean surfaces frequently, such as countertops, light switches, cell phones and other frequently touched areas.

Stay home if you are sick.

  Juror Information  




Introduction

	The purpose of this information is to acquaint jurors with a few methods and procedures that relate to jury service and selection in Pennsylvania’s Court of Common Pleas. The Court of Common Pleas are Pennsylvania’s general trial courts.

	These courts are organized into judicial districts, generally following geographical boundaries of the state’s counties. In most judicial districts, juries hear a wide range of cases. Please take time to review so you are better informed about your responsibilities and the importance of your role in the trial process.

	The Judges of the 39th Judicial District thank you for contributing your time for jury duty. The performance of jury service is the fulfillment of a most important civic obligation. Conscientious service brings its own reward in the satisfaction of a task well done. Jury service is one of the most valuable public services that the average citizen has an opportunity to perform.

	Trial by an impartial jury of citizens from the community is the cornerstone of the American judicial system by which our people judge and settle all controversies. Many other systems have been tried throughout the world, but our system is the one believed most likely to accomplish justice and fairness. It guarantees that no one person or government will dictate his or her opinion to others. It further guarantees that all final decisions involving our rights, liberty and property rest in capable hands of the honorable men and women of the community who serve as jurors.

Quick Tips for Jurors


		• Bring something to read or do to pass the time spent waiting.

		• As a prospective juror, you are permitted to bring handheld electronic devices(smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc.) with you to the courthouse; HOWEVER, they are not permitted to be turned on when Court is in session and/or while in a jury deliberation room. Electronic devices shall not be used to obtain or disclose any information about any cases. No exceptions.

		• Get directions to the courthouse in advance.

		• Before the date you are scheduled to appear, find a convenient place to park if you are driving. The county provides free parking at the lots described in the FAQ section about Jury Duty.

		• If you use public transportation, find out which route you need to take and time schedules to arrive on time.

		• Plan to arrive early, as there are often time delays due to security screening, especially on jury selection days. 

		• All jurors will be required to go through a metal detector. When in doubt, leave items at home or in your car. 

		• Food in general is not permitted in the courthouse; however, given the importance of your duty, the Courts recognize medical, dietary, and related needs.  Food for these noted needs will be permitted in the courthouse on selection days.

		• In the event of inclement weather or an emergency develops on selection days, please contact Court Administration at 717-261-3848 and leave a message.  Staff needs to hear from you and will follow up accordingly.

About

	The Franklin County Office of Open Records provides access to public information and enforces the state’s Right-to-Know law.  Its function is to serve as a resource for citizens, public officials and members of the media in obtaining public records of Franklin County.  The County has adopted its own Open Records Policy to implement this Law.  Please refer to the document found on this webpage for a full explanation of the regulations and procedures governing the County’s Open Records Law.

Open Records Policy

What are some examples of public records?

	• 911 time response log

	• Name, title, salary of public employees and officials

What are some types of information that will NOT be available?

	• Social Security numbers

	• Drivers’ license numbers

	• Employee numbers

	• Home, cellular or personal phone numbers

	• Personal financial information

	• House addresses of law enforcement and judges

	• A minor’s name, home address, date of birth

	• Pre-decisional deliberations

	• A transcript or copy of a 911 recording (without a court order or subpoena)

	• A record from a Court or court-related office (except financial records). 

	These records must be requested directly from the appropriate office since they are part of the unified judicial system and do not fall under the requirements of the Open Records Law.  For example, civil case information can be obtained through the Prothonotary, criminal court information through the Clerk of Courts, and District Court matters can be obtained through each respective Magisterial District Judge office.

The law requires the open records officer to do the following

	An Agency has five business days to respond in writing and: 1) grant the request; 2) deny the request (citing the legal basis for denial/partial denial); or 3) invoke a 30-day extension for certain reasons.  The clock starts the day after the request is received during regular business hours.

How to request information?

	You can make a request four ways:  mail, fax, e-mail or in person.

	The request must be sufficiently “specific” to allow the public body to identify what you are seeking.

Is there a form to obtain records?

	Yes, a standard Franklin County Office of Open Records request form is available on this webpage.  The Franklin County Office of Open Records will also accept the form from the Pennsylvania Office of Open Records.

Are there fees associated with open records?

	Yes.  Please see the fee structure found on this webpage for the fees structure established by the Franklin County Commissioners in accordance with the law.

	If you disagree with a determination of the Open Records Officer, you may file an appeal to the Pennsylvania Office of Open Records.  Guidelines and forms for appeals may be found at https://www.openrecords.pa.gov/

  Magisterial District Judges 





		Magisterial district courts are responsible for adjudicating all traffic and non-traffic citations as well as processing criminal and private criminal complaints inclusive of arraignments and preliminary hearings, the handling of civil and landlord tenant complaints up to a jurisdictional limit of $12,000 as well as parking violations.

		 

		Magisterial district judge’s jurisdiction in criminal cases includes parking violations through other summary and misdemeanor and felony offenses including the initial phases of murder offenses. All misdemeanor and felony violations are more commonly called court cases. These categories of cases are filed in the district courts where they are preliminarily arraigned and afforded a preliminary hearing. At the conclusion of the preliminary hearing the charges are dismissed, waived to court or held for court and referred onto the Court of Common Pleas.

		 

		Magisterial district judges, as officers of the Pennsylvania Unified Judicial System, may administer oaths and affirmations and take acknowledgements. They also have authority to perform marriages. It is up to the individual judge’s decision whether he or she wishes to perform marriage ceremonies as there is no legally prescribed form for a wedding ceremony so religious services and vows conform to the secular content in which they are used.

		 

		Pa.R.J.A.605 - Supervision of Magisterial District Courts by President Judges

		 

		(A) The president judge of the court of common pleas of a judicial district shall exercise general supervison and administrative authority over magisterial district courts within the judicial district. 

		 

		Magisterial District Courts use the PAePay online system for the payment of fines and costs at all of the magisterial district courts.  This allows an individual to pay fines, costs, restitution, collateral etc. online from any internet connected computer.

	You can also find additional election information on the SURE Public Portal at http://www.pavoterservices.state.pa.us

First-time Voters Provisions

	As a result of the Help America Vote Act (HAVA), if you are voting in an election district for the first time, you will be asked to present an approved form of identification before you sign the poll book.

	Approved forms of identification include:

	• Photo Identification (must be valid):

	• PA Driver's License or ID Card issued by PennDOT 

	• ID issued by the U.S. Government  

	• ID issued by any Commonwealth of Pennsylvania agency  

	• U. S. Passport  

	• U. S. Armed Forces ID  

	• Student ID or Employee ID  

	Non-Photo Identification (must include your name and address):   

	• Voter Identification Card issued by the Voter Registration Commission 

	• Non-Photo ID issued by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  

	• Non-Photo ID issued by the U.S. Government  

	• Firearm Permit  

	• Current bank statement  

	• Current utility bill  

	• Current paycheck  

	• Government check 

	Once you have provided approved identification, you will be asked to sign your name in the poll book and be allowed to vote if the signature is found to be authentic.  If you are unable or unwilling to provide one of the above forms of ID, then you may vote by a provisional ballot. 

Overvoting a Ballot

What is an Overvote?

	An overvote occurs when an indiviaul indecates on his/her ballot a vote for more candidates than the number of candidates for which an individual is permitted to vote for a particular office.

Does the optical Precinct Counters address Overvoted Ballots?

	Yes, the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) requires that a voter be notified if they have overvoted prior to casting their ballot so that they have the opportunity to correct their overvote. When a voter places their ballot into the Precinct Counter with an overvote, the counter will produce an audio alert and indicate on the LCD screen that an overvote has occurred. At this point the voter has the choice to "CAST" their ballot as is or push "RETURN" to retrieve their ballot back for correction.

What is the Result of an Overvoted Ballot that is "Returned" by the Precinct Counter?

	When the voter selects "Return" on the Precinct Counter's LCD screen, the ballot will be returned to the voter without any votes being counted.  The voter will then need to present their overvoted ballot to the election officials to be spoiled and ask for a new ballot. 

What is the Result of an Overvoted Ballot this is "Accepted" by the Precinct Counter?

	When a voter overvotes for a particular office, all of the votes cast by that voter for the overvoted office are CANCELLED.  

	For example, the office of Commissioners on the Municipal Election ballot states to "Vote for NOT MORE THAN TWO" although there are three candidates actually elected.  If you mark the oval to the left of the three candidates for County Commissioner, you have overvoted and none of the candidates wil receive a vote.  

	This will not cause your entire ballot to be cancelled, just the votes for the office of County Commissioner. 

How do you avoid an Overvote?

	Be sure to read the voting instructions on the ballot before voting.

	If you inadvertently vote for more than the allowed number of candidates for a particular office, ask for a new ballot. 

Undervoting a Ballot

What is Undervoting?

	Undervoting should not be confused with overvoting.  A voter undervotes when they cast fewer votes for a particular office than is permitted to cast.  NO BALLOT OR VOTE WILL BE CANCELLED AS A RESULT OF AN UNDERVOTE.  Also, the Precinct Counters are not programmed to detect and notify voters when it encounters a ballot that is undervoted. 

	If you are confused as to whether you have overvoted or undervoted, please do not hestitate to ask for instructions from an elections officer. 

Provisional Voting Procedures

What is Provisional Voting?

	Provisional voting is a new voting process that ensures that registered voters are not denied the right to vote because they are not listed in the district poll book, or are unable to provide approved identification when required.

	County election officials will begin to examine the provisional ballots no later than seven (7) days after the election to determine whether the individual voting that ballot was entitled to vote at the election district in that election. 

What is a Provisional Ballot?

	A provisional ballot is a paper ballot that is printed in the same format as other paper ballots except on green paper.  Provisional ballots are returned unopened in the proper security envelopes to the County Board of Elections, who has the responsibility to determine in a public meeting whether the provisioanl voter was qualified to vote.   

Who may Vote by Provisional Ballot?

	Individuals are to be provided the opportunity to cast a provisional ballot if:

	• The individual appears to vote and claims to be properly registered and eligible to vote in the election district, but the election official cannot verify their registration. 

	• The individual does not have an approved form of identification the first time they appear to vote in an election district. 

	• An election official asserts that the individual is not eligible to vote. 

	• The voter is voting as a result of a federal or state court order.

How do I know if my Provisional Ballot Counted?

	Within seven (7) days after the election, the County Board of Elections will begin to examine the provisional ballot to determine the validity of your completed provisional ballot.  

	At least seven (7) days after the election, using the information provided to you on the provisional ballot identification receipt given to you at your polling place, call 1-877-VOTES-PA or visit http://www.votespa.com.  Provide your provisional ballot identification number.  You will be told whether your provisional ballot was counted, you will be told why your provisional ballot was not counted.
