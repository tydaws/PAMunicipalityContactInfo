What are Election Boards?
All primaries and elections are conducted by a district election board consisting of a judge of election, a majority inspector and a minority inspector of election, assisted by clerks and machine inspectors in certain cases. The judge and inspectors of elections are elected by the electors at the municipal election and hold office for a term of four years from the first Monday of January next succeeding their election. The person receiving the highest number of votes for inspector is elected the majority inspector with the second highest number of votes determining the minority inspector.
A Constable is present during each election and while the votes are being counted for the purpose of preserving the peace. All are paid positions.
Volunteer positions called “watchers” are also present on election day. Each candidate at a primary or election may appoint two watchers that are allowed to stand outside the polling place and hand out information on their candidate. Watchers must be qualified registered electors of the County in which they are authorized to act.

Do You Know these Interesting Voting Facts?
“Procedure for Voting” – At primaries only those persons registered and enrolled in one of the established political parties are entitled to vote for candidates. However, any registered voter, regardless of party enrollment, is entitled to vote for any special question to be voted on at any primary election. At municipal or general elections, the elector my vote for candidates individually, or he may vote a straight political party ticket in one operation.
At the polling place on the day of election, each voter who desires shall be instructed in the operation of the voting device before he enters the voting booth. If any voter shall ask for additional instructions concerning the manner of voting after entering the voting booth, any election officer may give him audible instructions without entering such booth.
“Provisional Ballot Voting Procedure” – At all elections an individual who claims to be properly registered and eligible to vote at the election district but whose name does not appear on the general register and whose registration cannot be determined by the inspectors of election or the county election board shall be permitted to cast a provisional ballot. Individuals who are voting for the first time at the election district shall be required to produce identification.
“Rules and Regulations” – Not more than twice as many electors waiting to vote as there are voting compartments or voting machines in use in the district, shall be admitted within the enclosed place at any one time. This does not include persons who are rendering assistance.
No elector shall remain in the voting compartment or voting machine booth an unreasonable length of time, and in no event for more than three minutes. If he shall refuse to leave after said period he shall be removed by the election officers. Provided, however, that they may grant him a longer time if other electors are not waiting to vote. At municipal or general elections, the elector may vote for candidates individually, or he may vote a straight political party ticket in one operation
“Those who do not vote abandon their right to choose, as well as their right to complain.”
