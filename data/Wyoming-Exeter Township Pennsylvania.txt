Voting Information









Exeter Township has 11 voting precincts (click here for a precinct map).  According to the Pennsylvania Election Code, full discretionary authority to select polling places is given to the County Board of Elections.  Unlike the selection of polling places, the boundaries of an election district or precinct cannot be changed without the consent of the Court of Common Pleas. This is true in the case of splitting, combining or reconfiguring precincts.
Preference is given to public buildings and public schools under the election code. Other considerations are:

Parking - when the voting district is large
Location - sites near the population center of the district are preferred.
Notoriety - polling sites should be well known in the locality.
Security - well-lit and safe locations are needed for voters and workers alike.

The following are Exeter Township's polling sites in order by precinct number:

Qualifications To Vote In PAIn order to be eligible to register to vote, you must:


You must be a citizen of the United States for at least one month.


You must be a resident of Pennsylvania and your election district for at least 30 days before the next election.


At least 18 years of age on or before the day of the next Primary, Special, Municipal, or General Election.


Important Notice - On December 26, 2000, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court ordered the removal of the felony conviction prohibition as a qualification for voter registration. When completing the Voter Registration Mail Application (VRMA), a convicted felon who is released from prison may submit an application to register to vote by striking through the felony conviction line at Section9(2) on the VRMA and signing his or her name.


In order to vote in any specific election, you must be registered 15 days prior to that election. If your voter registration form is complete, your registration is effective 10 days after processing by the Department of Elections. If you do NOT receive a Voter Registration Card, contact the Elections Department.


If you wish to receive a mail-in ballot or absentee ballot by mail, a written application must be received by the Department of Elections at least seven days before the election. The mail-in or absentee ballot must be returned no later than 8:00 p.m. on election day.


You must re-register whenever you move, in order to protect all of your rights as a voter and potential nomination petition signer.


Please remember to include a full residential address and a mailing address, if different, when filling out a Voter Registration Application by mail. We can no longer accept Rural Route addresses or P.O. boxes for voter registration. A house number and street or road name are required. If you get your mail at another address it would need to be provided on your application.Qualifications for Voters at a PrimaryThe qualifications for a voter entitled to vote at a primary are the same as a voter entitled to vote at an election, except that he or she must be registered in a political party in order to vote in that party's primary. However, all registered voters are entitled to vote on questions placed on the ballot or at a special election held concurrently with a Primary.
