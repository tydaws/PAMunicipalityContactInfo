CHAPTER VII.
LACK TOWNSHIP, Part I.
By A. L. 
Guss


	The Juniata Valley region was purchased from the Indians July 6, 1754. 
Settlers had been intruding on this land before this date, and were driven away, 
but they returned. At length, in 1750, the justices of Cumberland County, with the 
undersheriff passed through Sherman's, Path and Tuscarora Valleys and the 
Cove in Fulton County and dispossessed the intruders. It was at last determined 
to purchase this region as the only sure method of averting serious trouble. This 
was effected on Albany, at the date above given. A great many men in the 
Cumberland Valley and farther eastward were ready, at the signal, to locate upon 
the more desirable places. The Land-Office for the sale of warrants did not open 
until February 3, 1755; but the number of settlers who had already "squatted" in 
the new purchase may be inferred by the fact that in three months after the 
purchase, at the request of said inhabitants, four townships were formed out of 
the new territory, of which the following is an exact copy of the official 
record:
	"The Court's erection and nomination of new Townships tother side the N 
Mountain.
	"At a meeting of the majestrates in conjunction with the Commissioners & 
Assessors of Cumberland County at Carlyle the 23d day of October, 1754, it was 
concluded that WHEREAS there has been an addition made to the County 
aforesaid by a late purchase from the Indians: to erect the habitable parts added 
to the said County into separate Townships and to appoint Constables in the 
same for the better regulation thereof. 
	"Therefore, at the request of the Inhabitants, we do erect the settlements 
called the Great Cove, the Little Cove & Cannaloes into one township, and 
nominate the same the Township of Ear and we appoint John McMeans to act as 
Constable therein for the remaining part of this current year. 
	"And farther, we erect the settlements called the Path Valley into a 
separate Township and nominate the same the Township of Fanet, and we 
appoint John Bard to act as Constable therein for the remaining  part of the 
current year - and we do further erect the settlement called Tuskerora Valey into 
a 
sepparate Township and nominate the same the Township of Lac, and we 
appoint John Johnston to act therein as Constable for the remaining part of the 
current year - and we do further erect the settlements called Sherman's Valley 
and Bufolo's creek into a separate Township and nominate the same the 
Township of Tyrone, and we appoint John Scott X. Linton to act as Constable 
therein for the remaining part of the current year. 
     "In testimony whereof we have hereunto subscribed our hands the day & year 
first written. 
	"Sam'l Smith. 
	"Will. Maxwell. 
	"John Finly." 

	By the above, Tyrone township included all the present Perry County; 
Fannet embraced Path Valley, in Franklin County; "Ear" was named after Ayr, in 
Scotland, and comprehended the present Warren township in Franklin County, 
all of Fulton County, and with general indefinite limits westward, embracing 
Bedford County; Lac comprehended all the Tuscarora Valley and included part of 
Huntingdon County.  It will be observed there are no lines mentioned. It is only 
stated that certain settlements shall constitute the townships named. 
	On the 9th of July, 1755, Braddock was defeated, and the French and 
Indian War ensued, and no records are found relating to the new townships.  In 
1761 there are constables' returns, of "Aire" by William Lynn, and of Fannet by 
James Elder. Lack is named in the list of townships, but the space for the 
constable's name is left blank, which shows that few or no people had returned to 
that settlement. 
	On March 25, 1762, the court made the following appointments: Fannet, 
Francis McConnell constable; "Aair,""William Haynes constable; Lack, Ralph 
Starret constable, William Andersona and John McMehan supervisors; 
Fermanagh, William White constable. Anderson and White were killed by the 
Indians the next year, on the 10th of July. 
	On March 25, 1763, the court made the following appointments: Lack, 
John McClelland constable, Robert Campbell and Robert Houston supervisors, 
William Graham and John Erwin overseers, James Williams collector. 

	All other persons appointed for Lack resided in what afterwards became 
Milford township. In 1768 Lack was divided, and the lower half was called Milford. 
In 1825 Lack was again divided, and the lower half called Tuscarora. It is 
bounded northward by the Black Log Mountain, southward by the Tuscarora 
Mountain, and eastward by Tuscarora, westward by Tell township, in Huntingdon 
County. Shade Mountain separates Black Log Valley, drained by Black Log 
Creek into the Aughwick, from the rest of the township. The rest of the township 
is drained by the Tuscarora Creek and its inflowing streams, the principal ones 
being Willow Run (formerly Little Tuscarora), Wood's Run and George's Creek. 
The township is traversed by ridges running parallel to the mountains. The Shade 
Valley side and the creek side are more thickly peopled than the intervening 
ridges. 
	The first assessment was taken in 1763 by William Anderson, who was 
killed by the Indians in that year. In the following lists the reader must bear in 
mind that prior to 1769 Lack covers the half of the county west of the river. These 
lists must be taken as part of the history of all the townships formed out of 
Lack. 
LACK TOWNSHIP ASSESSMENT OF 1763 - Abbreviations. - In 
the following list, taken from the records at Carlisle, "a" stands for acres, "w" for 
warranted, "p" for patented, "ac" for acres cleared, "h" for horses, "c" for cows, 
"s" for sheep, "uns" for unseated. The townships in which the lands of the person 
taxed are now situated are marked "L" for Lack, "M" for Milford, "T" for Tuscarora, 
"Tt" for Turbett, "B" for Beale, "SH" for Spruce Hill. The tax in the 1763 list is in

COUNTY AND TOWNSHIP LINES.-It will be remembered that Lack at 
its formation had no specified limits. It was the settlement called "Tuscarora." The 
mountains at each side gave it shape on the south and north. The formation of 
Milford limited it on the east. The west end was undefined and long uncertain. It 
is very probable that the limits between Lack and Ayr were on the dividing waters 
running into the Tuscarora and Aughwick. The formation of Dublin township, in 
1767, is so imperfectly defined as to the eastern limits that nothing can be 
determined by it. It was to bound "Ayr and Fannet townships on the one side," 
but Lack is not mentioned, and there are no dividing lines as to Ayr or Lack. The 
first Dublin assessment, in 1768, shows no transfer of names from Lack. The 
only thing that places any part of Dublin east of the Shade mountain is that it was 
to join on Fannet, which lay on the other side of the Tuscarora Mountain. It is 
probable that the Tell township waters draining into the Tuscarora Creek were 
still regarded as part of Lack. One of these streams is called Trough Spring. 

   That Lack extended, for many years, much farther up the valley than the 
present limits of the township and county is very apparent from the tax-lists and 
records of the Land-Office and the county surveyor's office. 
   The original idea that Lack was to take in the whole Tuscarora settlement was 
not interfered with by anything on the west prior to the formation of Bedford 
County, in 1771, and as this line was never run, it is probable that most of the 
few scattered settlers in this region still regarded themselves as in Lack. After the 
act of April 1, 1791, defining the "north line," more began to fall into their proper 
townships; but it was not  until the line was surveyed under the act of March 29, 
1792, that all knew in which county and township they actually lived. By the 
division of Dublin, forming Tell, in 1810, the ancient seats of these pioneers, so 
long undefined, fell into the latter township. So it may be truly said, that although 
Huntingdon is recorded as all taken from Bedford County, yet it did take a slice of 
what was locally regarded as still a part of "old mother Cumberland." 

TAXABLE INDUSTRIES.-The tax lists of Lack from 1763 to 1831 show 
assessments on the following in addition to lands and stock. Those that fell into 
Tuscarora in 1826 are marked "T."
