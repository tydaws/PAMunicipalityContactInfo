How to Get Rid of Bamboo. Although bamboo is known for its beauty as an ornamental and a landscaping focal point, you may find that you need to get rid of bamboo that has become a problem.  Various species (more than 1,200) of bamboo, which are technically large evergreen grasses, are used as ornamentals throughout landscapes.  Bamboo offers either a clumping or a spreading habit.  Imagine a grass that grows to 8 feet tall with a woody stem that has the persistence of crabgrass.  Now imagine that your neighbor plants it as an ornamental and it spreads like crazy until it is also on your property. A few links below, shared by the Penn State Master Gardener Program, will assist you in getting rid of Bamboo: http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/cs/groups/public/documents/document/dcnr_010270.pdf http://homeguides.sfgate.com/way-kill-bamboo-plant-52907.html http://homeguides.sfgate.com/kill-bamboo-permanently-38065.html http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Rid-of-Bamboo

Recycle your Furniture & Housewares 
The Community Warehouse Project has the goal of eliminating bulk waste by collecting gently used furniture and housewares and then distributing these items to families, individuals, and veterans in need throughout Chester County. Donating your items is a great way to recycle perfectly usable items instead of them going to the landfill. 
The warehouse is located at 800 E. Virginia Avenue, Building 3, West Chester, PA 19380 near Henderson High School. Donations must be pre-approved by sending photos to donations@communitywarehouseproject.com or to our phone at 484-473-4360. They are open for drop-offs on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday from 9am to 12pm, and everything third Saturday of each month from 9am to 1pm. Other drop off dates are available by appointment.
 
Please email or call with any questions gbrion@communitywarehouseproject.com or 610-505-2200.

Cleaning up after your PET:
Pet Waste Can Affect Water Quality
Despite ensuring that your pets don’t defecate directly into water sources, their waste can still affect community and natural bodies of water. Some pet owners may erroneously assume that depositing excrement into a storm sewer is a viable disposal method. Storm sewers, however, empty into lakes and streams. Along with polluting the water with bacteria and parasites, pet waste that finds its way to natural bodies of water promotes the flowering of unwanted algae and weeds. Chemical reactions that take place in the water after coming into contact with pet waste can also negatively affect wildlife and contribute to the reduction of fish populations.
