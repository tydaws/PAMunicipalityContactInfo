Silver Lake Township
Susquehanna County, PA






Welcome
Silver
        Lake Township is a rural township in Susquehanna County in North-Central
        Pennsylvania. Our northern border is on the state line, and is approximately
        ten miles south of Binghamton, NY.
Our major industries are agriculture, forestry, and the mining and
        processing of Pennsylvania bluestone. Many of our residents are entrepreneurs,
        and own small construction and manufacturing companies; others work
        across the border in New York State. We also have quite a number of
        local artists that do painting, sculpture, and woodworking that sell
        their products locally and regionally.
Our location at the northern portion of the Endless Mountains provides
        us with many beautiful hills and glacial lakes, making us a preferred
        location for second homes. We get many visitors that come to take advantage
        of our sailing, boating, fishing, and outdoor sports opportunities.
