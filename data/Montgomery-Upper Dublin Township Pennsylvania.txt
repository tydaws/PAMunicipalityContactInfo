Voters who move within the state within 30 days prior to an election may vote in that election at their previous election district.

Registration books close 30 days before any election and are reopened five days after a Primary Election and 30 days after General or Municipal Election. Electors may also register to vote online.

ELECTION PROCESS
Local organization of political parties is based on the County Committee of each party. Its membership consists of two people from each voting district who are elected by the voters every two years at the Primary Election. Committee people also serve on a township committee where they act as party representatives and select a slate for nomination to local offices at the Primary Election.
While the party committee names a slate, others may run for Primary nomination by meeting the legal qualifications for the office in question, obtaining the required number of signatures, and filing papers with the appropriate authority by the filing deadline. Contact the County Board of Elections for additional information

Spotted Lanternfly Information







 ⁄Environment⁄Spotted Lanternfly Information                    




Lycorma delicatula, commonly known as the Spotted Lanternfly (SLF), is a new invasive insect that has spread throughout southeastern Pennsylvania since its discovery in Berks County in 2014. SLF presents a significant threat to Pennsylvania agriculture, including the grape, tree-fruit, hardwood and nursery industries, which collectively are worth nearly $18 billion to the state's economy.

Signs & Symptoms
The Spotted Lanternfly attacks fruit trees, but not the fruit itself. It uses its piercing-sucking mouthparts to feed on the sap in trunks, branches, twigs and leaves. These oozing wounds will leave a greyish or black trail along the bark of the plant.
As it digests the sap, the insect excretes a substance known as honeydew that, along with sap from these weeping wounds, can attract bees and other insects. There may be a buildup of this sticky fluid on infested plants and on the ground below. The honeydew and sap also provide a medium for growth of fungi, such as sooty mold, which can cover leaf surfaces and stunt growth. Plants with heavy infestations may not survive.
What's at Risk
Potentially at stake are Pennsylvania's grape, tree-fruit, hardwood, nursery and landscape industries, which generate agricultural crops and forest products worth nearly $18 billion annually. The insect also can cause damage to high-value ornamentals in home landscapes and can affect quality of life for residents.
Where it's Found
SLF is currently found in 34 counties in Pennsylvania, all of which are under a state-imposed quarantine. The quarantine is in place to stop the movement of SLF to new areas within or out of the current quarantine zone and to slow its spread within the quarantine. The quarantine affects vehicles and other conveyances, plant, wood, stone products and outdoor household items. Counties within the quarantine zone: Allegheny, Beaver, Berks, Blair, Bucks, Cambria, Cameron, Carbon, Chester, Columbia, Cumberland, Dauphin, Delaware, Franklin, Huntingdon, Juniata, Lackawanna, Lancaster, Lebanon, Lehigh, Luzerne, Mifflin, Monroe, Montgomery, Montour, Northampton, Northumberland, Perry, Philadelphia, Pike, Schuylkill, York, Wayne, and Westmoreland. In addition to Pennsylvania, SLF is also found in New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Connecticut, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, and West Virginia. Do your part to slow the spread by complying with the SLF quarantine relations.

Hurricane Ida Survivor Resources

02/17/23 ANNOUNCEMENT – Hurricane Ida Relief Fund (HIRF)

Upper Dublin Township is pleased to announce the newly-created Hurricane Ida Relief Fund (HIRF), financed by a $1.5 million grant from the Pennsylvania Department of Community & Economic Development. This grant was secured by State Senators Maria Collett and Vincent Hughes to ease the financial strain experienced by property owners and residents impacted by the tornado and flooding of Hurricane Ida. Upper Dublin shares this grant with Horsham Township. March 31, 2023, is the deadline for Round 1 applications for HIRF consideration. Property owners and residents with eligible storm-related expenses are strongly encouraged to submit an application as soon as possible. For full program information, eligibility guidelines, and application materials, please visit www.upperdublin.net/hirf. Paper application materials are available at the Township Offices at 370 Commerce Drive. If you have any questions, please contact hirf@upperdublin.net or call 215-643-1600 ext. 3138.

Upper Dublin Township Hurricane Ida Recovery Resource Coordinator (“HIRRC”)

Upper Dublin residents that have been affected by the tornado and flooding associated with Hurricane Ida are encouraged to reach out the the HIRRC at storm@upperdublin.net or by telephone at 215-643-1600 ext. 3378 to discuss their disaster-related needs.  The HIRRC may coordinate with UDT personnel or provide referrals to community resources suited to support storm survivors’ needs.

Hurricane Ida Disaster Case Management Program

Montgomery County residents still experiencing unmet needs related to Hurricane Ida can contact the Disaster Case Management Program at 833-461-8IDA (8432).  This is a free service that partners an individual or household with a trained Disaster Case Manager (DCM), who will perform a comprehensive assessment of your needs and help you to access eligible resources.  A DCM will advocate on your behalf with FEMA, insurance companies, the Small Business Administration (SBA), and other disaster-related services. Spanish-speaking Disaster Case Managers are available.
Program Flyer:  English | Spanish
Note: As part of the initial intake, residents will be asked to provide information on any Ida-related assistance they may have previously received from Montgomery County or non-profit, social service, or disaster assistance agencies.  Failure to provide this information could result in a duplication of benefits and may affect eligibility for any future assistance.

Insurance Questions & Issues with Insurance Companies
Do you have questions related to your insurance policy? Have you had an issue while filing a claim with your insurance company?  If so, you may contact the Pennsylvania Insurance Department's Consumer Service Bureau for assistance.  They can be contacted online or via phone at 1-877-881-6388.  The form can also be downloaded and submitted to Rep. Todd Stephens at toneill@pahousegop.com
Tax Relief for Catastrophic Property Loss
The Montgomery County Board of Assessment Appeals offers relief for anyone who has experienced a catastrophic loss to their property. The reduction to the assessment is based on the amount of damage sustained.  Relief is offered for damage from Hurricane Ida, as well as for ANY other catastrophic loss (e.g., fire, flood, tornado, hurricane, etc.).  If you believe that your property has suffered significant damage, please contact the Board of Assessment Appeals at 610-278-3761 and ask to speak to the assessor for your area.  The assessor will visit your property and make a determination if it warrants a reduction in tax burden due to catastrophic loss.
Replacement of Deeds
The Montgomery County Recorder of Deeds office will provide, free of charge, a certified copy of deeds lost or destroyed by Hurricane Ida.
