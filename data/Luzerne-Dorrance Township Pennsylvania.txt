RECYCLING CENTER WILL BE CLOSED

Posted on August 3, 2020  by  William Wengrzynek 


The recycling center will be closed on August 8, 2020 and will remained closed until further notice while the program is being re-evaluated.
A large amount of trash, items that are not acceptable recycling materials and unclean recycling is an issue for the future of our recycling program. The unacceptable materials are costing the Township more money as we are paying for it to go to the landfill.
