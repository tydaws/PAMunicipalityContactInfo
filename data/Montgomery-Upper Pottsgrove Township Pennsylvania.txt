ANNOUNCEMENTS 



Township News:

 










Upper Pottsgrove Municipal ComplexListed below is a summary of findings for each environmental study that was performed on the future Municipal Complex property.• The Phase I Environmental Site Assessment found no history of contamination on the subject property, therefore there is no impact to the proposed municipal complex.• The wetland scientist discovered a small (1,300 sq./ft.) wetland area on the property, located over 300 feet from the proposed municipal complex area. The wetland area poses no impact to the project, nor will there be any impact to the wetland through the development of the municipal complex.• The stormwater report revealed no water infiltration at 2 of the 3 identified soil study sites with depth to rock being around 60”. Proposed utilities should not extend deeper than the 60” bedrock threshold and the lack of water infiltration will be considered in the design of the new stormwater management facilities. Both of previous findings were previously anticipated by the design team and will have minimal effect on the design of the proposed municipal complex.After evaluating the site of the municipal complex and in consultation with the site architect from Alloy5 Architecture, the site location approved by the Upper Pottsgrove Board of Commissioners (370 Evans Road – Parcel number 60-00-02089-01-1) is a suitable location from an engineering, architectural, and environmental prospective to build a municipal complex that not only includes the police, administrative and public works facilities but expands upon the recreation needs of the community.The Board of Commissioners should consider developing the remainder of the Smola Tract for public recreation use and ecological preservation, creating a municipal complex that also includes the following amenities:• Development of the Tri-County Upper West Trail segment through the property, allowing trail users and municipal residents to walk/hike between the Perkiomen Trail and the Schuylkill River while also being able to walk to community meetings/events that would occur at the municipal site.• Offer recreation amenities and programs that were found to be lacking within the community, as identified in the YR 2020 Municipal Open Space Plan. Some amenities and/or programs, listed in the Open Space Plan, may be better suited for a municipal complex/recreation facility where support facilities (parking, restrooms, meeting rooms) are easily accessible.• Develop wetland, drainage channel and riparian buffers throughout the property, contributing to the health of the Manatawny and Sprogels Run watersheds. Both watersheds not only contribute to the water quality of the Schuylkill River but provide habitat for plant/animal species bio-diversity.• Minimize lawn maintenance and allow meadows/forested areas to naturalize the remainder of the complex property. Naturalized land areas further increase plant/animal species bio-diversity within the Upper Pottsgrove area, unlike the monoculture of the existing soybean farm (contains little to no wildlife/plant diversity value).The municipal complex (administrative/police offices, public works facility and associated paving) comprises a total of 1.2 acres of impervious surface area or 3% of the total Smola Tract.In summary, the municipal complex is well suited for the Smola tract considering the minimal impact to the overall site, the possibilities of expanding the use of the land to include a municipal recreation complex that expands trail connections, provides additional public recreation/programming opportunities while preserving/encouraging natural open space areas that promote plant/wildlife biodiversity.Please call our office with any questions.Sincerely,Aloysius Gryga, RLADirector of Planning & Landscape ArchitectureCMC EngineeringKeith Marshall, PEManager of Engineering ServicesCMC Engineering********************************************************Upper Pottsgrove Municipal Complex Memo to Mae Axelrod ofNatural LandsOn behalf of Upper Pottsgrove Township, thanks for sharing the announcement that Oliver Bass (President of Natural Lands) is sending to The Mercury news outlet regarding the new municipal complex. The offices of CMC Engineering are Land Planners, Landscape Architects and Civil Engineers that have been hired by Upper Pottsgrove Township to manage the site development of the new municipal complex. We’ve been asked to respond to Natural Lands concerns regarding the location of the new municipal complex. Locating the new municipal complex at the Smola Open Space Tract was a decision that the Board of Commissioners didn’t take lightly. Many factors, including gently sloping terrain, ease of vehicular access to major roadways in emergency situations, minimal disturbance to neighbors/environment and access to public utilities are just a few of the factors that were considered when selecting the new municipal complex site. Of the 35.2 acres that comprises the Smola Tract, only 1.2 acres of land (just over 3% of the total property area) will be used for the new municipal complex (administrative/police/public works facilities, including surface parking). The proposed municipal complex will NOT utilize 10 acres as has been continuously and purposefully misrepresented to the public. The proposed municipal complex is similar in size to the LenFest Center that the Natural Lands built at the ChesLen Preserve, which is currently being marketed for commercial use by hosting private banquets.Further, prior to choosing this ground for the municipal complex back in 2020, the Township reviewed any restrictions which would potentially impact the proposed municipal use. Both the prior solicitor and the current solicitor opined that the property could be used for the municipal complex. The land is not preserved open space which again is a fact that has been continuously and purposefully misrepresented to the public. It is municipal owned land and the proposal is to use it for a municipal purposes, to stop the current business use of the property, and to make the ground more usable by the public. Currently, the public cannot access the ground as it is being utilized by a farmer and there is no safe access to the land. The proposed municipal complex will eliminate the current business use and will provide safe parking and access areas immediately. Eventually, the plan is to create a network of trails on the land so that the public will have full access to the property.The proposed municipal complex is divided in half between two watersheds, the Manatauny and Sprogels Run. Stormwater management facilities will be designed for the new facility to manage runoff according to Municipal Land Development standards. The new stormwater facilities would encourage infiltration, manage flooding, and improve water quality. Farm fields are notorious point source polluters for watersheds. 1.2 acres of land will no longer shed fertilizers, pesticides and silt directly into the two watersheds. The minimal amount of fertilizer that will be used on the new municipal complex site will be managed by the new stormwater facilities, reducing pollution. 1.2 acres of heavily managed land that would normally shed water and soil directly into the surrounding watersheds will not do so as the rainwater will be stored and released/infiltrated over a 72-hour period, reducing flooding. Relocating the police/public works (PW) facilities to the Smola Tract will allow the Township to improve upon the amenities that are located at Heather Place Park, which directly abuts the current police/PW facility. Allowing the old 0.8 acre police/PW facility to be converted into a recreation/open space use will offset most of the development area being proposed for the Smola Tract while expanding the recreation amenities in this area.Thanks for your time and please let me know if you have any questions.

The average monthly residential wastewater bill for Upper Pottsgrove customers increased by $41.00 (63.1%). Following the company’s acquisition of the Upper Pottsgrove wastewater system, the company maintained Upper Pottsgrove’s prior rates until new company rates took effect. The increase makes Pottsgrove’s wastewater rates more consistent with Pennsylvania American Water’s existing base wastewater rate structure.Need assistance paying your bill?  Pennsylvania American Water has several customer assistance programs for customers who qualify.LEARN MORE: Visit pennsylvaniaamwater.com.Rates: Under Customer Service & Billing, select Your Water and Wastewater Rates.Customer Assistance Programs: Under Customer Service & Billing, select Customer Assistance Programs.You may also call Pennsylvania American Water at 1-800-565-7292.********************************************************Dead Deer on the Road ~ Call the PA Game Commission at (610) 926-3136; Press 1 to report.For PennDOT Roads (N.
