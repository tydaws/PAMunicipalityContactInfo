At the January Civic Club Meeting we will be working on our "STARS FOR OUR TROOPS" Project with a Star Party!  Come and learn about it.  We need your assistance at this "PARTY!"  in creating the packets to be distributed to currently serving and retired Military and First Responders!  

Please bring a pair of scissors - OR
You can help to assemble the baggies with the stars and the "You are not alone" verse.  
If you have the name of someone we can send a Star to or you want to send a Star to with your personal Thank You For Your Service - we have them for you to share.

We prepared and distributed over 1000 Star Packets in the Fall of 2022!! (Started the project in September.)  We want to do that again for 2023 - we have so many opportunities coming, we don't want to be caught short on packets.  We received over 70 flags from the Rochester VFW and continue to acquire more.  
Mark your calendar so you don't forget!

The Township was just notified by PennDot that Bocktown Road is closed due to repairs being made to a slide. They were concerned that the travel lane was becoming too small and too close to the slide.


The detour is the same as the one in done in 2021, McGovern to Harper to Bocktown and in reverse.


We will post updates as information becomes available.


 


Crescent Township Household Hazardous Waste & Electronic Waste Collections

Look through your home for hazardous items that need discarding –everything from batteries and paint to computers and chemicals –and feel secure knowing Republic Services will handle these special items, protecting both you and the environment!
Residents who call will be asked to describe the items they want collected. They will be asked to use a special kit to collect the items, which will be delivered to them.
Each kit includes a 42-gallon clear plastic bag and detailed instructions on how to safely package the items, along with a collection date. These items MUST be kept in a secure location; NOT at the curb, until collection. The only exception is a single item weighing 50 lbs. or more, such as a large TV, which must be placed at the curb.
On the collection day, Republic Services personnel will collect the specially packaged items and recycle them.
