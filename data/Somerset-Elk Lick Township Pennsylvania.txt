    Elk Lick was so named from the 
    fact that within the township was a lick which the elk and deer used to frequent. 
    The township was organized as a division of Bedford county about the year
    1785.  Settlements were made very early by immigrants of German and
    Irish birth.    Elk Lick township contains rich deposits of
    coal, iron ore and limestone.  Since the building of the railroad the
   development of these products has become an important industry. 

    The first settled farm is believed to have been that now
        owned by John W. Beachly, situated immediately north of the town of Salisbury. 
    The settler was Joseph Markley, who became the owner of a tract of land extending
    from the mouth of Pine Run along the Casselman river to the mouth of Meadow
    run,  thence along Meadow run for a distance of about one and one-half
        miles; thence north to Pine run; thence following Pine run to the place of
        beginning.  The date of settlment was probably between the years 1755
        to 1760.  Markley also claimed a portion of the land on the opposite
        side of the river, being a part of what is now the David Livengood farm. 
    A man named Judy also laid claim to the same land.  One day the two
        claimants met on the hill on the opposite side of the river, and proceeded
        to settle the dispute by a fistic encounter.  Judy was vanquised in
        the fight, and Markley continued in possession.  From this affair arose
        the name of Flog Hill.
