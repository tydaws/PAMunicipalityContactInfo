To demonstrate a collective resolve that Pennsylvanians will prevail over COVID-19 and work tirelessly to ensure that their businesses and civic life will thrive once again.

Mayors and other elected officials are encouraged to support this initiative.  Then at 7:00 PM, all Pennsylvanians and churches will be encouraged to ring bells for three (3) minutes – one (1) minute for each of the above purposes and residents and churches are encouraged to turn on their porch lights and light up their places of worship for three (3) hours – one (1) for each of the above purposes.  Proclamation Bells Across Pennsylvania DayMunicipal Building300 South McKean StreetKittanning, PA 16201Phone: 724-543-2091Fax: 724-548-5029Monday-Friday 9:00am-4:00pmPublic NoticesKittanning Borough Clean Up DaysMay 9, 2023 | NewsClean Up Days begin on May 15, 2023 and End on May...Borough Meeting Minutes April 2023May 2, 2023 | NewsBorough-minutes-April-2023DownloadKittanning Borough Council Meeting AgendaApril 28, 2023 | NewsMeeting date May 1, 2023 at 6:00 PM Council Chambe...Arts on the Allegheny Concert, Saturday June 10th, Ricky Skaggs & Kentucky Thunder- FreeApril 24, 2023 | NewsApril 21, 2023 | NewsBP-70C31_20230421_092821DownloadNotice from Street Dept in regard to yard waste.April 19, 2023 | News*No trash *No weed barrier material *No sticks big...Minutes from March 6th 2023 (will be moved to Minutes section)April 17, 2023 | NewsMarch-6-2023-Council-Meeting-Minutes_DownloadStreet Sweeping Begins April 17, 2023April 10, 2023 | NewsStreet Sweeping will begin on Monday April 17th, 2...View All Public Notices
