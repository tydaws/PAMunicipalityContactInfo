ORDINANCE 222 – STORMWATER FEE ORDINANCE (12/1/2020)
SECTION X: STORM SEWER REVENUE FUND
The funds received from the collection of the Stormwater Management Fee authorized by this Ordinance shall be deposited into a Storm Sewer Revenue Fund, a fund and account hereby created and dedicated to the operation, administration, maintenance, repair and improvement of the Storm Sewer System and compliance with associated regulatory requirements.

2021-2022 GREEN VALLEY PARK STORMWATER CONTROL AND POLLUTION REDUCTION PROJECT
New Sewickley Township is completing the first project as part of its MS4 Permit Pollutant Reduction Plan requirements. The improvements being completed at Green Valley Park will improve the water quality of Brush Creek as well as help control the runoff in the park. The Township is currently installing 16 new storm sewer inlets and approximately 2,100 linear feet of new storm sewer conveyance pipe. This additional infrastructure will capture the stormwater runoff and better convey it to Brush Creek. Additionally, the improvements include construction of a new rain garden, including a Focal Point system. This new rain garden will control the discharge of the stormwater throughout the park by detaining it for a longer period of time. Additionally, the Focal Point is a Biofiltration System that filters the stormwater through its designed media, removing pollutants that are within the stormwater, improving the overall water quality that reaches Brush Creek.
The New Sewickley Township Board of Supervisors authorized the award of Contract No. 21-SW1 – 2021 Stormwater Improvements (Green Valley Park) to A. Liberoni, Inc. in the total amount of $330,114.25 at the December 6, 2021 Board of Supervisors Meeting. 
The Township received a grant for up to $230,000 for this project through the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Thank you to State Senator Elder Vogel Jr. and State Representative Jim Marshall for their support for this project and our Township. 


























2021 POWELL ROAD PROJECT
The Township Road Department completed slope stabilization and stormwater sewer improvements on Powell Road between Brush Creek Rd. and Mellon Rd. The improvements included installing multiple catch basins, creating end walls, and adding additional underground pipe crossings to reduce erosive surface flow and limit future road damage due to slides. This project was funded in part by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s Dirt, Gravel, and Low Volume Road Maintenance Program and administered by the Beaver County Conservation District. Thank you to State Senator Elder Vogel Jr. and State Representative Jim Marshall for their continued support of this program.

Trade Up
Building the Future
Trade Up offers credentials and skills that lead to family-sustaining wages.
A new collaboration with Builders Guild of Pennsylvania and Literacy Pittsburgh offers adults without a high school diploma a chance to earn that credential and seamlessly transition to the Introduction to the Construction Trades pre-apprenticeship course.  Those who successfully complete both programs are guaranteed entry into an apprenticeship in the construction industry.
The construction industry in the 12-county southwestern Pennsylvania region is facing an unprecedented labor market shortage.  At the present there are nearly 52,000 construction jobs, with a projected growth rate of 9.2% over the next 10 years.  At the same time, 30 to 35 percent of current tradespeople are expected to retire over the next few years.

Township Manager
724-774-7822
rleindecker@newsewickley.com
The manager of New Sewickley Township, is also the Township’s Zoning/Building Code Enforcement Officer and is responsible for enforcing  the Township Zoning Ordinances.
When a building/zoning application is submitted to the Township, the Manager reviews the application to see that it is conformance with the Township Zoning Ordinance.
If you are planning on completing any construction  you should always make sure that the proper building permits are obtained.
Structures from 200 sq. ft. up to 1000 sq. ft. in size require a Township zoning permit at the cost of $30.00.  This includes sheds, garages, pavilions, gazebos and other accessory structures such as metal carports.  Structures that are 1000 sq. ft. or greater require both a zoning permit and a building permit for compliance with the Pennsylvania Uniform Construction Code.
The Township’s Zoning Ordinance can be found here.

MS4 Stormwater Outreach & Training Meeting




February 17, 2022 – 6:30PM – Big Knob Grange






On December 7, 2021, the Board of Supervisors approved Resolution 12-21 that expanded the stormwater credit program to include a credit for properties that have an approved USDA/NRCS Conservation Plan. The Resolution also offered the ability to appeal impervious areas that are qualified Agricultural Best Management Practice Plans as recommended by the Beaver County Conservation District or USDA/NRCS.




On Thursday, February 17, 2022 New Sewickley Township in conjunction with the Beaver County Conservation District (BCCD) held a MS4 Outreach and Training Meeting to offer assistance in applying for Stormwater Fee credits for residential and agricultural properties with more than 10 acres of land.
Items discussed included how the BCCD can assistance property owners with their Erosion and Sediment (E&S) Control Plans, Nutrient and Manure Plans, and other federal and state programs that offer assistance to agricultural properties. A breakout session took place that offered assistance on Forest Management Plans also.
