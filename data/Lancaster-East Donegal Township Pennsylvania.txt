General Recycling Information
The recycling materials gathered at curbside in the Township are delivered to, and processed by Penn Waste.  The use of Penn Waste’s single stream recycling facility allows you to place all of your recyclables in one container for collection. No sorting is needed.
Tips To Get Ready for Pickup
Placing your bin in the appropriate area for pickup and following the simple steps below will help ensure your materials are collected on your designated pickup days:

Check the weather. If the weather forecast calls for high winds or rain, keep your recycling inside until the following week, if possible. Wet paper is more difficult to process.
Place your bin out the evening before the scheduled pickup day.
Ensure any loose paper or light cardboard is covered with heavier materials. This will help ensure your materials do not blow out of the bin.
Bundle any large or loose pieces of cardboard that will not fit inside your recycling bin.
Collect your recycling container as soon as possible after pickup to prevent it from blowing away.

Below is an overview, provided by the Lancaster County Solid Waste management Authority of the materials that may be recycled.  These steps help ensure that your recycling efforts are contributing to a greener future.

2023 Township Scholarship Information Now Available 
The 2023 East Donegal Township Board of Supervisors Scholarship Program information, and application, is now available for pick-up at the Township Office, 190 Rock Point Road, or can be downloaded HERE.
Started in 2015, the program awards a $1,000 scholarship to a graduating senior currently attending Donegal High School, and a resident of East Donegal Township, that plans to further their education as a full-time student at an accredited junior college, college, university, or vocational school.  Award money is for one year only and for the purposes of tuition, books, and fees only.
A scholarship award selection considers (no priority given) field of study, character, scholastic record, involvement in community work, written recommendations and extracurricular activities of all applicants in determining the scholarship recipient.  Financial need is not an eligibility factor.
The application deadline is 4:00 PM April 13, 2023. Winners will be notified in writing by May 8, 2023 and will be invited to attend the Donegal School District’s Acedemic and Athletic Awards Program to be held on Monday, May 22, 2023.  The winner will also be asked to attend an East Donegal Township Board of Supervisors meeting and have their picture taken for the Township newsletter.
Scholarship awards will be paid directly to the school attended by the scholarship winner upon receipt of verification of enrollment at a college, university, or vocational school, successful completion of one semester of full-time enrollment and invoice of tuition for second semester of enrollment.
Employees and Board of Supervisors of East Donegal Township and their immediate family members are not eligible.Share this:Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)
