Township News		
Posted on: December 20, 2021Updated Snow Removal Information Before the Snow FallsMake sure the front of your mailbox is at least a four to six   inches behind the front of the curb and mounted at height of four feet.  Mailboxes closer to the curb and lower to the ground are most likely be damaged by the weight of snow being pushed from a plow.  Take time to make sure your mailbox is sturdy enough to withstand the weight of snow being pushed into it.  Make sure to clear snow from all walkways, stairs and paths to mailboxes.  For confirmed cases of mailboxes being damaged by plow operations, West Goshen Township will provide a new black or white mailbox and a wooden post.    Trim tree branches hanging over the road.  All tree, shrubs, etc. that are protruding into a roadway, must be cleared by the property owners of the trees.  Trees may not extend closer than a distance of three feet from the road and fifteen feet up.Consider installing driveway markers.  If your property does not have a curb or other method to delineate the edge of the street, orange driveway markers, available at home repair stores, can help plow drivers know where the edge of the road is and avoid damage to your property.      Keep cul-de-sacs and roads free of parked cars from the time snow starts until the roads are cleared.  In the case of steep driveways, park at the mouth of the drive, but off the road.  If a car is parked on the roadside or cul-de-sac, we may not finish plowing that street, but return several hours or even the next day to complete work. While Roads are Being PlowedDo not place shoveled, blown, or plowed snow from driveways, sidewalks, or parking lots onto public streets.  This is extremely dangerous and is a violation of Chapter 70 (“Streets and Sidewalks”) of the West Goshen Code, punishable by fines up to $1000.00 per day.  The ordinance also prohibits piling snow into storm gutters.When shoveling your driveway, leave the last six feet of you drive unshoveled until plowing has ceased.  This unshoveled part will allow the snow being pushed by the plow to remain on the plow and not dumped into your drive.  If you must shovel out your drive, clear a six-foot area of the road that is directly in front of the mouth of your drive.  In addition, clear an area ten feet before and after the mouth of your drive, so that when the plow comes through, it will unload snow that it is pushing in the cleared area and not in the mouth of your driveway.  Use the illustration to the left as a guide for shoveling before the roadways have been cleared.Be Patient.  Snow removal does take time, especially in heavy snowfall.  West Goshen Township will usually plow potentially dangerous and heavily traveled areas first.  Drivers begin one pass in each direction on streets and one pass into and out of cul-de-sacs.  We may not finish plowing that street, but will return several hours or even the next day to complete the work.  Any residual snow will be pushed back from streets when the storm has ended.Note that West Goshen Township does not clear all streets within the Township.  Private roads, certain Home Owner Associations and State roads are not plowed by the Township.View the Township's Snow Removal Code HEREMaTownship Code Info...

Posted on: February 24, 20202020 Census Information The 2020 Census is right around the corner!The count is mandated by the Constitution and conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, a nonpartisan government agency. The 2020 Census counts the population in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and five U.S. territories (Puerto Rico, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Each home will receive an invitation to respond to a short questionnaire—online, by phone, or by mail.Why We Conduct The Census?The census provides critical data that lawmakers, business owners, teachers, and many others use to provide daily services, products, and support for you and your community. Every year, billions of dollars in federal funding go to hospitals, fire departments, schools, roads, and other resources based on census data.The results of the census also determine the number of seats each state will have in the U.S. House of Representatives, and they are used to draw congressional and state legislative districts.It's also in the Constitution: Article 1, Section 2, mandates that the country conduct a count of its population once every 10 years. The 2020 Census will mark the 24th time that the country has counted its population since 1790.Participating in the census is required by law, even if you recently completed another survey from the Census Bureau. A complete and accurate count is critical for you and your community, because the results of the 2020 Census will affect community funding, congressional representation, and more.Overall TimelineCounting every person living in the United States is a massive undertaking, and efforts begin years in advance. Here's a look at some of the key dates along the way:2020January 21: The U.S. Census Bureau starts counting the population in remote Alaska. The count officially begins in the rural Alaskan village of Toksook Bay.March 12 - 20: Households will begin receiving official Census Bureau mail with detailed information on how to respond to the 2020 Census online, by phone, or by mail.March 30 - April 1: The Census Bureau will count people who are experiencing homelessness over these three days. As part of this process, the Census Bureau counts people in shelters, at soup kitchens and mobile food vans, on the streets, and at non-sheltered, outdoor locations such as tent encampments.April 1: Census Day is observed nationwide. By this date, every home will receive an invitation to participate in the 2020 Census. Once the invitation arrives, you should respond for your home in one of three ways: online, by phone, or by mail. When you respond to the census, you'll tell the Census Bureau where you live as of April 1, 2020.April: Census takers will begin visiting college students who live on campus, people living in senior centers, and others who live among large groups of people. Census takers also begin conducting quality check interviews to help ensure an accurate count.May - July: Census takers will begin visiting homes that haven't responded to the 2020 Census to help make sure everyone is counted.December: The Census Bureau will deliver apportionment counts to the President and Congress as required by law.2021March 31: By this date, the Census Bureau will send redistricting counts to states. This information is used to redraw legislative districts based on population changes.Here are some of the efforts completed in 2019:January - September: The Census Bureau opened more than 200 area census offices across the country. These offices support and manage the census takers who work all over the country to conduct the census.August - October: Census takers visited areas that have experienced a lot of change and growth to ensure that the Census Bureau's address list is up to date. This process is called address canvassing, and it helps to ensure that everyone receives an invitation to participate in the census.Census Day 2020April 1 is Census Day, a key reference date for the 2020 Census. When completing the census, you will include everyone living in your home on April 1, 2020. Census Day will be celebrated with events across the country.For More InformationPlease see the 2020 Census website for more information.
