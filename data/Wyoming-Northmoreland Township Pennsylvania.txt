Come back and everything is as you left it. There is few robberies around here mane one or two a year. There is a lot of shoplifting though. Tunkhannock is really safe, where I work the police drive around the building once an hour. The managers wear buttons to contact police if needed and they call within a minute of hitting the button to ask if everything is okay. If you don't answer the police show up like as soon as they get no answer. My neighbor hood is really safe.Niche UserJan 30 2016Crime & SafetyReportStart Your Review of Northmoreland TownshipRate It!Rating 5 out of 5  Tunkhannock is a small town, but everyone knows someone or everyone. Most people are really friendly. Tunkhannock is full of hicks. Everyone loves the country air. We have so many farms around here. You can go next door and ask to borrow something and most people will be really nice to you. Everyone loves their right to bare arms here. My neighbor is retired and target practices every day. It's a nice little town to live in.Niche UserJan 30 2016Overall ExperienceReportRating 4 out of 5  Everyone is friendly with each other.Niche UserJan 30 2016CommunityReportadd-to-listAdd to ListNicheAbout UsNiche For SchoolsNiche For CollegesBlogResource CenterContact NicheDataCareersPartnershipsPressDo Not Sell My Personal InformationPrivacy PolicyUser AgreementWeb AccessibilityCookie PolicySitemapInstagramFacebookTwitterTiktokDiscordYouTube©2023 Niche.com Inc.Discover the schools, companies, and neighborhoods that are right for you.K-12CollegesGraduate SchoolsPlaces to LiveDo you work for a school or college?
