The Solanco School District is comprised of students from Bart, Colerain, Drumore, East Drumore, Eden, Fulton, Little Britain, and Providence Townships, along with Quarryville Borough. The School District contacted the Quarryville Police in 2016 to discuss the possibility of having an Officer assigned as a School Resource Officer, or SRO. Nearly every district in the County has an SRO assigned to the schools: some have had SRO's for 15 years.In addition to the Officer's regular training, the SRO must attend specialized and on-going training specific to the duties and functions of an SRO. The Quarryville Officer assigned , Chris Dilworth, has already started this advanced training.The SRO is not a school disciplinarian. Disciplining students is a school responsibility. The SRO's function will be to ensure the safety of the students and staff in all of the schools in the Solanco School District. The SRO may speak to students in class regarding a variety of subjects to include, police and their role in society, criminal and vehicle laws, drug education, the criminal justice system, and more. The SRO will also investigate and take action when any crimes are reported on school property.Not every Township listed has a school located within their boundaries, however, on occasion the Guidance Counselor or School Nurse may request that the SRO accompany them on a home visit to a student's home.If you have any questions regarding the duties of the SRO you may contact Officer Chris Dilworth at 717-786-2151 (the Solanco High School Main number) or Quarryville Borough Police Chief Clark Bearinger at 717-786-3121 or you may email him atbearinca@police.co.lancaster.pa.us

Below is some information you may find valuable; taxes are listed first (sorry!) because we get a lot of questions about our taxing system from new residents. I hope this information is easy to understand and helpful. Please call Carmen, the Township Secretary if you have any questions or concerns.
TAXES
In March you will be billed from the County and Colerain Township, or better known as The Spring Taxes

In June you will be billed from the Solanco School District for Property Tax or better known as The Fall Taxes
Solanco School District Tax Mils are 11.344 $ 100,000.00 x .011344 = $ 1,134.40Total Real Estate Tax with County, School and Municipal is 14.77 Mils or .01477 plus Per Capita*Please note the number of zeroes in front of each number before you multiply.PA State Sales Tax is 6%.PA State Income Tax rate is 3.07%Solanco School District Local Tax is 1.65%

Welcome






Welcome to Colerain Township
Based on information gathered from the History of Southern Lancaster County, compiled by the Solanco Heritage Volunteers, and from Our Present Past, prepared by the Historic Preservation Trust of Lancaster County, Colerain Township was organized as a township in 1738. It was settled mainly by the Irish. Colerain Township covered 19,479 acres and was named after a seaport town in the county of Londonder, Ireland. Records show that Presbyterian Scots and Scotch-Irish also moved into Colerain Township very early in the settlement.

Joe Chrisman of MAC Resources is responsible for the issuance of building permits and inspection of construction sites.  If you are contemplating any improvements or alterations to your home, property, or business, contact Joe at the Township Building to discuss your plans and determine if any permits or approvals are required by the township.  We recommend this before spending large sums of time, effort, and money on formal plans.  Joe also assigns house numbers. 
Building Permits are required by the Township for new structures, some of which are storage sheds, greenhouses and tobacco drying sheds. They are also needed for remodeling and renovations as well as sign installation, highway occupancy and septic systems. 
Specific questions regarding building permits, etc. should be directed through the Zoning Officer, Joe Chrisman. He can be reached at the Township Building Mondays 12-4 and Thursdays 8-12 at 717-529-2570. All others are by appointment; he can also be reached at 610-721-2561. Joe's email address is jchrisman@macinc.consulting
