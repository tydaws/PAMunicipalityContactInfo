Park & Recreation
The East Norriton Township Parks and Recreation Department is dedicated to providing various classes, trips and activities to the residents of East Norriton Township and beyond! We host a number of successful programs including; a senior bocce league, a youth soccer league, a youth basketball league, a great summer camp program and more. 

We also offer annual special events such as, Movie in the Park, our Summer Concert Series, Community Day, a holiday Tree Lighting Ceremony, as well as an Easter Egg hunt for the community. In addition, discount tickets for amusement parks and ski areas are sold during the appropriate season and discount movie tickets are available year-round. Special interest programs and bus trips are offered at various times throughout the year as well.
East Norriton Township is also home to eight Township maintained parks. These parks make up over 117 acres of various trails, educational areas, picnic space, basketball courts, playground equipment and more. The Township also maintains our Veterans Memorial and the Norris City Cemetery.  More information on each of these parks and spaces can be found under the "Department Links" on the right side of this page. 
Stanbridge Street Park is the largest of these eight parks and the one that offers the most amenities. It is the host to several of our special events listed above, such as Community Day, Movie in the Park and our Summer Concert Series. It is also the home of our popular Senior Bocce league, as we maintain two bocce courts with a scoreboard, picnic area and canopied players area. These bocce courts are available for rent through the Township. Stanbridge Street Park also has two updated tennis/pickleball courts, recently renovated in 2018, a outdoor basketball court, a sand volleyball court, a lighted softball field and various playground equipment! There is a one-mile paved walking trail that loops through our beautiful grounds and connects to the very popular Norristown Farm Park trail. The latest addition to the Stanbridge Street Park is the Clubhouse at Stanbridge Street Park. This indoor facility is available for rental and can be utilized in many ways. The Township has held small recreation programs, special training events and even a Mom's group to name a few! Also available for rental is our newly updated Pavilion. This covered picnic area with numerous charcoal grills is a popular choice for graduation parties, birthday parties and even team building days!
