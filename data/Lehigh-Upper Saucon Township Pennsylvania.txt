Home >COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Information and Preparedness 


COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Information and Preparedness 

COVID related information is changing rapidly as scientists, medical professionals and various other disciplines learn more about the Coronavirus every week. 
For the most recent information residents should refer to the CDC or their own trusted medical provider. Don’t rely on content posted to social media sites. 
 
As a community service we will keep some basic relevant information on our website. 
NPIS for Community Preparedness
CDC recommends individuals and families follow everyday preventive measures:
Voluntary Home Isolation: Stay home when you are sick with respiratory disease symptoms. 

Respiratory Etiquette: Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, then throw it in the trash can.

Hand Hygiene: Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with 60%-95% alcohol.

Environmental Health Action: Routinely clean frequently touched surfaces and objects.
Routine use of these measures by individuals and their families will increase community resilience and readiness for responding to an outbreak.
NPIs for COVID-19 Outbreaks in Communities

Personal Protective Measures. During an outbreak in your community, CDC recommends the everyday preventive measures listed above—especially staying home when sick—and taking these additional measures:

Keeping away from others who are sick.

Limiting face-to-face contact with others as much as possible.

Consulting with your healthcare provider if you or your household members are at high risk for COVID-19 complications.

Wearing a facemask if advised to do so by your healthcare provider or by a public health official. Respect business owners and store operators by wearing masks if they have a mask policy. 

Staying home when a household member is sick with respiratory disease symptoms, if instructed to do so by public health officials or a health care provider (Voluntary Home Quarantine).

Community Measures. If COVID-19 disease is occurring in your community, state and local public health authorities may decide to implement:

Temporary closures or dismissals of childcare facilities and schools.

Other social distancing measures that increase the physical space between people, including:

Workplace social distancing measures, such as replacing in-person meetings with teleworking.

Modifying, postponing, or cancelling mass gatherings.

Decisions about the implementation of community measures will be made by local and state officials, in consultation with federal officials as appropriate, and based on the scope of the outbreak and the severity of illness. Implementation will require extensive community engagement and ongoing and transparent public health communications.

Home >COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Information and Preparedness 


COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Information and Preparedness 

COVID related information is changing rapidly as scientists, medical professionals and various other disciplines learn more about the Coronavirus every week. 
For the most recent information residents should refer to the CDC or their own trusted medical provider. Don’t rely on content posted to social media sites. 
 
As a community service we will keep some basic relevant information on our website. 
NPIS for Community Preparedness
CDC recommends individuals and families follow everyday preventive measures:
Voluntary Home Isolation: Stay home when you are sick with respiratory disease symptoms. 

Respiratory Etiquette: Cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, then throw it in the trash can.

Hand Hygiene: Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with 60%-95% alcohol.

Environmental Health Action: Routinely clean frequently touched surfaces and objects.
Routine use of these measures by individuals and their families will increase community resilience and readiness for responding to an outbreak.
NPIs for COVID-19 Outbreaks in Communities

Personal Protective Measures. During an outbreak in your community, CDC recommends the everyday preventive measures listed above—especially staying home when sick—and taking these additional measures:

Keeping away from others who are sick.

Limiting face-to-face contact with others as much as possible.

Consulting with your healthcare provider if you or your household members are at high risk for COVID-19 complications.

Wearing a facemask if advised to do so by your healthcare provider or by a public health official. Respect business owners and store operators by wearing masks if they have a mask policy. 

Staying home when a household member is sick with respiratory disease symptoms, if instructed to do so by public health officials or a health care provider (Voluntary Home Quarantine).

Community Measures. If COVID-19 disease is occurring in your community, state and local public health authorities may decide to implement:

Temporary closures or dismissals of childcare facilities and schools.

Other social distancing measures that increase the physical space between people, including:

Workplace social distancing measures, such as replacing in-person meetings with teleworking.

Modifying, postponing, or cancelling mass gatherings.

Decisions about the implementation of community measures will be made by local and state officials, in consultation with federal officials as appropriate, and based on the scope of the outbreak and the severity of illness. Implementation will require extensive community engagement and ongoing and transparent public health communications.
