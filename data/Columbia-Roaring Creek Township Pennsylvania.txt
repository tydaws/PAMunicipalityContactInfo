Many factories have closed and moved elsewhere. Some overseas, and most down south. Luckily we have a large Trauma hospital 15 miles from my home that employes 19000. That is by far the best employer. I am looking ahead at a career in plumbing/heating. There are so many private businesses in that field that I'm afraid too much competition will force me to move from my much loved community. We have a lot of farming areas here and scattered small industrial factories.Niche UserMay 17 2015CommunityReportStart Your Review of Roaring Creek TownshipRate It!Rating 4 out of 5  I live in a rural area in central PA. There are a lot of "mom and pop" stores still going strong. They are greatly supported by the community. In fact there is such a store 2 miles from my home celebrating 60 years. I would much rather support a store like this than go to big company store, even if I pay more for the product. Yesterday, I bought plants from a Mennonite store. Nothing like a friendly interaction that you receive from neighbors working hard to keep a needed business right next door.Niche UserMay 17 2015Things To DoReportRating 3 out of 5  We have beautiful 4 season weather. Love the change in seasons. Summer is warm, often very humid. Fall is the best season, changing leaves, nice temperatures. Winters are cold, with sometimes significant snowfalls. Spring is unpredictable, sometimes still cold and snowing on occasion. Other times we seem to skip spring and go straight to summerNiche UserMay 17 2015CommunityReportRead More Reviewsadd-to-listAdd to ListNicheAbout UsNiche For SchoolsNiche For CollegesBlogResource CenterContact NicheDataCareersPartnershipsPressDo Not Sell My Personal InformationPrivacy PolicyUser AgreementWeb AccessibilityCookie PolicySitemapInstagramFacebookTwitterTiktokDiscordYouTube©2023 Niche.com Inc.Discover the schools, companies, and neighborhoods that are right for you.K-12CollegesGraduate SchoolsPlaces to LiveDo you work for a school or college?
