Home Road District Seasonal Information 
















Seasonal Information 















PUBLIC EDUCATION AND OUTREACH 












Printed brochures are located at the front desk of the Road District office.  In addition, information can also be obtained through the township website. Community Brochure                      Emergency Brochure                  Summer Brochure                 Winter Brochure An information booth will be set up at local expo events where residents have the opportunity to gather information and ask questions. 




PUBLIC PARTICIPATION/INVOLVEMENT 












The public has the opportunity to participate in our Adopt-A-Highway program throughout McHenry Township Road District. When participating, residents would help remove roadside debris along dedicated sections of road. 




SANDBAGS CONTINUE TO BE AVAILABLE FOR FLOOD CONTROL 












The Road District will continue its policy of providing sandbags for pickup by residents for emergency flooding. Bags will be available Monday through Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. With one day’s notice, we will also provide sand. Call the Road District office at 815-385-3076. 




SPRING CLEANUP 












This work is usually completed in late spring to mid-summer:Repair of plow scars – completed in the spring. Please let us know if you see any that have not been repaired by mid-summer.Permanent replacement of damaged mailboxes from the previous winter – completed in the spring. Sweeping of roadway gutters and intersections – completed in spring and as needed throughout the year.Restriping the yellow and white lane lines on our main thoroughfares.  




MOWING RIGHT-OF-WAYS 












Generally, the right-of-ways are mowed three times annually. This usually occurs prior to Memorial Day, Fourth of July and Labor Day. There are several reasons for mowing but probably the most important reason is to prevent larger vegetation like noxious trees from taking over the right-of-way and preventing proper drainage. Additionally, we have completed re-vegetation of ditch back slope in our right-of-ways. This provides many benefits including improved habitat for pollinating species, reduced mowing costs and drifting barriers much like the snow fence we put up in our rural areas but on a smaller scale. It does provide some issues such as increased difficulty with garbage pick-up in right-of-ways. In addition, some natural vegetation is not compatible with the agricultural uses in our rural areas, so we will be avoiding those types of vegetation. Finally, this does require periodic burning of the vegetation to prevent unwanted noxious weeds.
