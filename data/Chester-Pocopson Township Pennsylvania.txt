Latest News

Spring 2023 Newsletter (3/1/2023)Pocopson Newsletter Spring 2023
 Traffic Study (5/9/2023)In the upcoming months, DVRPC will be collecting traffic count data on 2 roads throughout Pocopson Twp. These are the locations we will be counting:
Lenape Unionville Rd Bet Locust Grove Rd & Pa 52 Lenape Rd 
Pa 842 Unionville Wawaset Rd Bet Red Lion Rd & Bragg Hill Rd
Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC) routinely collects travel volume information in the nine counties comprising the Philadelphia metropolitan area.   Counts are typically collected at the request of your state DOT to fulfill Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) program requirements, at the request of the county planning/engineering office, or in support of planning staff evaluating transportation system performance or improvements.  This involves DVRPC staff laying a rubber tube across roadway facilities for approximately 48 hours (to gather daily traffic volumes), mounting video cameras, or manually recording traffic from a vehicle parked near an intersection (to gather turning movement information).  These efforts will not interfere with normal traffic operations on these facilities.
They invite you to visit the traffic counting section of their website (www.dvrpc.org), where all of their traffic count information is available to the public.  Once on the website, choose Open Data for prompts to Traffic Count Data. You will be offered a choice of viewing a map of all of their traffic count locations or searching counts by county, municipality or road name.
Tree Trimming Notice from PECO (5/5/2023)PECO will be doing routine maintenance trimming in various areas located in Pocopson Township. Your power will not be interrupted. If you have any questions, please contact PECO at 1-800-311-6345.
Local Vendors Wanted for Holiday Arts & Crafts Fair (5/5/2023)We are looking for local artists for our inaugural holiday festival in November.  Please click here for a vendor application. Early bird submissions get a booth discount.
If you would like to be a sponsor, we have a wide array of tiers, so you can sponsor the event for as little as $25.
More information to come on this community event, so stay tuned!
