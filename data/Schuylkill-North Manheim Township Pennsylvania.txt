All real property (land and improvements) in North Manheim Township is taxed by the Township, County and School District, except government and exempt facilities.    Real Estate Township Taxes are calculated by multiplying the millage (or tax) rate set by North Manheim Township Board of Supervisors, with the assessed value of the real property, as determined by the Count Assessment Office.  The millage rate is the amount the property is taxed per $1,000 of assessed value. You can locate the millage rates below.

Blue Mountain School District Tax Millage can be found here. Currently for 2022 - 42.8250
To calculate your tax bill, use the following formula with the tax rates found above:
Assessed value x Millage Rate  / 1,000 = tax amount
	For Example:                                                     
		
Property Actual Value at $100,000
Property Actual Value at $200,000
Assessed Value $50,000
Assessed at $100,000

Tax Collector
Real Estate Tax Bills are issued by the County and distributed by the Township Tax Collector twice a year.  The first mailing will occur on or around March 1st of the current year for the Township and County portions. (This will be broken down to each individual amount)  The second mailing will occur on or around July 1st of the current year for the School District portion of your taxes.   Please check your tax bill for due dates, discount and penalty periods.   In addition, please make note that tax payments are to be sent to the address of the Tax Collector that is listed on the bill.   This is NOT the Township Municipal Office address and payments should not be left in the dropbox. 
Questions can be directed to the North Manheim Township Tax Collector :  Peter Tobash
Blue Mountain School District also assesses an Occupational Privilege Tax that is issued with the second round of taxes.  You must contact that School District or Tax Collector if you have any questions regarding this tax or to see if you qualify for an exemption from this tax.
Earned Income Tax & Local Services Tax 
Both Earned Income Tax & the Local Services Tax are collected through your employer and are based on your earnings with Berkheimer Tax Administrator processing them.
Earned Income (EIT)
Earned income tax is 1% of  your earned income for North Manheim Township Residents split with the Blue Mountain School District at .5% each.
