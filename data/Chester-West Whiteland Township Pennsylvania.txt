Preservation
Historic resources are an important part of the Township's history and contribute greatly to the community's identity and overall unique character. West Whiteland has a rich history and has served as the crossroads at the heart of Chester County since the Revolutionary War.

Open Space







Room to BreatheOver 20% of the land in the Township is permanently protected open space. Any time land is subdivided or developed, whether for residential or corporate purposes, the developer is required to set aside a predetermined amount of land for open space and recreation. Township staff works with each developer individually and must approve the open space arrangements or assess an open space fee to secure adequate amounts of recreational areas for our residents.Read More
