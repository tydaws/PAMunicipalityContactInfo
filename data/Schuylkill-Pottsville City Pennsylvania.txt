City decorations include the beautiful city Christmas tree in Garfield Square, the transformation of Yuengling Park into a winter wonderland, the new holiday greeting sign that welcomes people to the Western entrance to Pottsville and the shooting stars that provide cheer and spirit to our downtown.Unfortunately, our downtown lights on are over 20 years old and need to be replaced.

Pottsville Brings Residents and Visitors Smarter Parking Options with the ParkMobile App














Pottsville, Pennsylvania - 4 October 2019 - ParkMobile, the leading provider of smart parking and mobility solutions in the United States, has partnered with the City of Pottsville to enable drivers to pay for parking from their mobile device. The ParkMobile app is now available at approximately 800 spaces around the city.
New stickers and signage will provide information to drivers on how to pay for parking using the app. ParkMobile is available for free for both iPhone and Android devices, and users can additionally register on parkmobile.io.
After setting up their account, customers can immediately begin using the system with their registered mobile device. Users simply enter the zone number posted on nearby signage, choose the duration of time they'd like to park, and hit the "Start Parking" button to begin their session. The ParkMobile app gives users the ability to pay for parking on-the-go by allowing them to remotely view and update or add time to their parking session - right from their mobile device.
Pottsville has the unique power of having only one zone number. With this structure, Pottsville allows users to pay for all-day parking only once, while still being able to move around the city freely.  This will now include areas along Centre Street and Garfield Square.
Historically, Pottsville has allowed for free parking after 5PM on weeknights and all weekends and holidays.  The Pottsville Parking Authority is pleased to announce that this courtesy will be continued.
ParkMobile has a growing audience in the Northeast with parking available in major cities like New York City, Boston, and Baltimore. The app is also widely available throughout other Pennsylvania markets, such as Harrisburg, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh.
"We're thrilled to expand our network to Pottsville," says Jon Ziglar, CEO of ParkMobile. "We want to provide every driver across the Northeast with a smarter parking experience that allows them to easily process their transactions using the ParkMobile app."
ParkMobile is the most widely used mobile parking solution in the country with more than 16 million people using the app over 60 million times per year across over 400 cities. ParkMobile is excited to make a difference leveraging its large network of users as it expands into Pottsville.
