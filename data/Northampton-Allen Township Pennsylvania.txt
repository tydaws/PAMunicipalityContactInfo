Please be advised that on or about May 1st, 2023 the Howertown Road Bridge (North of Rt. 329) will be limited to northbound traffic only for an extended period of time to facilitate the long-awaited replacement of the bridge over the Dry Run Creek.  

The purpose of the PennDOT, State Route (SR) 3017, Section 01B (Howertown Road) project is to replace the structurally deficient bridge with a precast concrete box culvert.  Click here for project location map.

The bridge replacement project consists of widening of Howertown Road to 12â-0â travel lanes and 8â-0â shoulders for approximately 300â on either side of the bridge in order to improve the sight distance and horizontal curve across the bridge.

Northbound traffic (one-lane) will be maintained during construction.  Southbound traffic will be detoured using PennDOT roads SR 3018 (Old Carriage Road) to SR 3021 (Seemsville Road).   Click here for official detour map.

Construction is anticipated to be completed by December of 2023.

Motorists are encouraged to follow the official signed detour route to avoid delays.

Motorists are advised to obey the posted speed limit along the detour route. Motorists are urged to slow down and drive responsibly in work zones.  Fines are doubled for speeding in a work zone.  Convictions of two or more speeding violations in a work zone could result in the suspension of an individualâs driver license.

Please use caution through these areas and allow yourself extra time to get to your destinations.  Allen Township is providing this information to advise citizens of the potential increase in traffic volumes on other roadways through the general area of the detour route.

All Township Real Estate tax payments must be mailed or paid in person at:

First Northern Bank and Trust, located at 102 Commerce Drive, Northampton, PA

  The bank will not accept your payment without the entire Real Estate tax bill. 

IMPORTANT STEPS WHEN PAYING BY CHECK OR PERSONAL ON-LINE BILL PAY:


*          All checks must be made payable to âAllen Township Tax Collectorâ.  Any deviation from this specific wording will result in non-acceptance of your payment.
*          When completing your check:  Legal line and numeric line must match, reference parcel ID on the memo line and check must be dated and signed.
*          If paying taxes for multiple properties on a single check, please notate all tax parcel IDs or bill numbers on the check. The Township is not responsible for delayed payments if your payment is applied to an incorrect parcel ID.
*          If you currently use online bill pay with your personal bank, please reference either your tax parcel ID or your bill number.
*          Please be aware that when using your personal online bill pay, your bank physically prints and mails a check to the Township Real Estate Tax Collector.  Do not wait until the end of the grace period to make payment since we may not receive it for several days.

The Public Works Department will begin sweeping the Township streets on Monday, March 27, 2023. Sweeping helps protect our waterways and keeps our neighborhoods clean and livable. Debris on the streets can clog storm drains and pollute our streams and rivers.  
      
Crews will post âNo Parkingâ signs prior to sweeping residential streets.  Parking will be prohibited from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. on the day of sweeping.
      
The street sweeper will begin in the areas of North Hills, Boro View, and Hampton Ridge before proceeding to the Allen Village and Kensington area. After these areas are complete the street sweeper will begin sweeping south of Route 329. 
      
How can residents help?  
      
To provide efficient and quick sweeping, our equipment needs to get to the curb without obstructions. Please observe the following:

The spring street sweeping program typically takes several weeks to complete and could be delayed by cold or wet weather, parked vehicles or excessive amounts of winter anti-skid material.
Please keep in mind that this is a very slow moving vehicle. Please use caution while passing.

Your cooperation and patience is greatly appreciated!

Please direct all street sweeping related questions or concerns to the Public Works Department by calling 610-262-7012 ext 105.   



  
Allen Township has received reports of door-to-door solicitation for the purpose of selling various goods and items (including solar panels). Please note that Allen Township requires each salesperson and helper to obtain a SOLICITATION PERMIT from the Allen Township office.
 
Follow these tips when it comes to door-to-door sales:


 - Ensure that the salesperson has obtained the proper permit from Allen Township (this is a small yellow laminated card that is issued from Allen Township). Allen Township reviews applications for each salesperson and has a copy of their driverâs license/identification card on file in the office. When applicable, Allen Township may take other steps to ensure the salesperson is who they say they are. For more information about this ordinance and requirements view the Code of Allen Township Chapter 13 Part 2 by clicking this link: https://ecode360.com/15947669. You can always contact the Allen Township Municipal Office (610-262-7012 info@allentownship.org) to verify if a solicitation/vendor permit has been issued for an individual.
 - Look out for red flags such as deals that are too good to be true or âfreeâ items or services.
 - Be wary of a salesperson who wants you to make a decision on the spot or sign an agreement, lease, or loan application. If you are interested in the product they are selling, take down their information and think about it for a while. Better yet look up reviews on the company/product and obtain other quotes from other vendors. If the salesperson does not have the time to answer your questions or seems as if theyâre dodging the question, it might be a scam. If you decide to contact the company for further information it is best to do a Google search of the company and contact them at the number provided on their website rather than a number that was provided to you.
 - Keep in mind that it is easy to carry a clipboard and have an âID badgeâ â this does not prove they are who they say they are.
 - Make sure your neighbors, friends, and relatives are aware of these types of sales so they do not fall victim.
 - Do not let anyone you do not know and were not expecting inside your home. Do not provide any information about your home, the people who reside in the home, your finances, or your day-to-day activities.
 - Do not sign anything and always read the fine print.
 - When in doubt, tell the salesperson that you are not interested and close and lock your door!

If at any time you feel unsafe you should immediately contact the police to file a report.

Allen Township residents who are serviced by the municipal hauler (JP Mascaro & Sons) are reminded that each residence may place one (1) bulk item out per week with their scheduled weekly garbage collection.

Examples include furniture, porcelain sinks/toilets, mattresses, and rolled up and tied rugs no larger than 3âx6â. Due to a growing problem with bed bugs, all mattresses and box springs must be wrapped with plastic before placement at the curb for collection. Unacceptable materials that will not be collected include construction materials, hazardous waste, electronics, tires, yard waste, grass clippings, or additional household trash.

*Electronics are NOT included in the White/Metal Goods collection or Bulk Item collection.

Please be advised that the Township has been contacted by USDA regarding the confirmation of the Spotted Lanternfly and added to the area of quarantine effective September 21st, 2017 due to the confirmed present of the invasive Spotted Lanternfly. The quarantine is an important legal designation.  The quarantine order directs residents and municipal authorities to follow guidelines to prevent the movement of Spotted Lanternflies at any stage of development.  This includes inspecting all wood and vegetation that might leave a quarantined municipality, in addition to inspecting vehicles, trailers, and other mobile equipment prior to moving it out of a quarantined area.     
  
The Spotted Lanternfly is an invasive that is new to the United States.  Spotted Lanternflies are native to Southeast Asia, but they have been introduced to other areas of Asia as well - including Korea, where Spotted Lanterflies are a major pest to agriculture.  Spotted Lanternflies are reproducing quickly in areas of southeastern Pennsylania and have become a major threat to Pennsylvania's agriculture and forestry industries.
  
The Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture general quarantine imposes limitations for moving the following items from the quarantine area:
  *	Any living life stage of the Spotted Lanternfly
  *	Brush, debris, bark or yard waste
  *	Landscaping, remodeling or construction waste
  *	Logs, stumps or any tree parts
  *	Firewood of any species
  *	Packing materials like wood crates
  *	All plants and plant parts
  *	Outdoor household articles like RV's, lawnmowers, chairs, grills, tarps, tile, stone,lumber and trucks or other vehicles not stored indoors.
  
  However, you can still move these items and similar items if you complete the Certification Checklist found at the link below.  Plant nursery, mulch producers or other similar commercial enterprise should contact the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture regarding the necessary compliance agreement.
