Gipe Road Bridge Update

From County Bridge Engineer
Preliminary design has just started with survey being just completed. Once a new bridge layout has been completed, preliminary drawings will be sent to Chanceford Township and meetings will be held with property owners to discuss any temporary and permanent Rights of Way needs. Final design is expected to be completed by April of 2023 with the project going out to bid for construction in July of 2023. The plan is to have the bridge opened to traffic by winter of 2023 with any final paving and restoration being completed in the spring of 2024. For any project related questions, please contact Steve Malesker, Senior Project Manager at HRG or email [email protected]
