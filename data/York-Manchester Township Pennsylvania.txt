Spring 2023 Newsletter















 





Smoke Testing Sewer Lines – 
Monday through Friday – 7:00 am to 3:30 pm.
Manchester Township Public Works Department periodically conducts smoke tests of the sanitary sewer lines.
Smoke should not enter premises unless a leak is present. This smoke is non-toxic, non-corrosive, and will not leave a stain. If smoke enters a home, it will soon dissipate. Opening doors and windows will help. Any presence of smoke within the house should be reported to the township office at 717-764-4646.
Avoid unnecessary exposure to the smoke. The smoke is relatively harmless, but all smoke is temporary and quickly disappears after exposure has ceased.
Smoke Testing Areas (Neighborhoods and Right-of-ways)
During March and April, 2023.
Brittany Developments, Aslan Heights, The Ridings, Emigsville
