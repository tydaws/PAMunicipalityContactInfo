Pennsylvania American Water to Continue Additional Water Testing Following East Palestine Train Derailment; Still No Impact to Drinking Water





Date: March 13, 2023


Pennsylvania American Water to Continue Additional Water Testing Following East Palestine Train Derailment; Still No Impact to Drinking Water


Pennsylvania American Water’s sources of drinking water in western Pennsylvania were not impacted by the February 3 train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio. There is no geographic connection of our water sources to the impacted area, and there is no possibility of impacted tributaries running into our upstream sources of supply. Testing following the incident showed no detection of chemicals from the train cars in our water sources, nor in the drinking water leaving our treatment facilities.
However, for continued public confidence and peace of mind, we will continue to perform additional water testing for potential contaminants related to the incident. Our plan includes bi-weekly sampling and testing for n-Butyl Acrylate, 2-Ethyl Hexanol, 2-Ethylhexyl Acrylate, Dioxins, Vinyl Chloride, and other Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) throughout the months of March and April. We will continue to assess our sampling plan following several rounds of bi-weekly test results and will continue to post updates and test results on our website here. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) is also conducting additional testing of the water source for our Ellwood water system and will be posting lab results on their website here.
Our water continues to meet state and federal drinking water standards. The health and safety of our customers are a top priority. As part of our daily water quality protocol, we monitor our water sources and perform water quality tests during the treatment process. Find out more about your water quality and the source(s) of supply for your drinking water system by viewing pg. 5 of your Water Quality Report. 
Most Recent Test Results

Note: “Raw” water means water drawn from the source, prior to treatment. “Effluent” means water that has gone through the treatment process and is going to customers. “ND” means not detected.

 What HappenedOn Friday, February 3, 2023, at approximately 9:30 p.m., a Norfolk Southern train had 53 cars derail in East Palestine, Ohio. The site of the derailment is less than one mile from the Pennsylvania border. Water and soil monitoring has been ongoing in nearby communities in Beaver and Lawrence counties. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and Norfolk Southern (under EPA order and supervision) have all been collecting and analyzing water and soil. 
   

DEP Water and Soil Sampling and Results DEP began by sampling private drinking water wells and public water supplies, then added surface waters, and then soil.See sampling locations, dates, and results as they become available in this 
   easy-to-use interactive map:
 DEP sampled all private drinking water wells and public water supplies (Ellwood City and Beaver Falls) within the two-mile radius of the derailment site and will resampled them in coming weeks. If you live in the two-mile radius and had your private well sampled, you’ll receive a phone call when results are available, followed by a final report in the mail.Surface waters (streams, rivers, and lakes) were sampled within a one-mile radius. Additional locations could be sampled if threat or source of contamination is discovered.   Soil is being sampled within the two-mile radius zone and within an area nearly three and a half miles downwind of the derailment site. Sampling locations were determined by placing a grid over these areas. The grid squares measure 2,000 feet by 2,000 feet, and samples are collected where the lines intersect. By using grid sampling, DEP can evaluate the entire area around and downwind of the derailment site for potential deposition. DEP is trying to accommodate as many individual requests as possible for soil sampling, and if there's a request near a gridline intersection, a sample is taken at that location. All soil test locations and results are posted on the DEP GIS map as they become available.Air QualityFive of the train cars contained the hazardous material vinyl chloride. Norfolk Southern scheduled a controlled vent and burn of the vinyl chloride from all five railcars on the afternoon of February 6. The air plume from the vent dissipated, and air quality monitors around the perimeter of the derailment site did not measure any harmful pollutant levels entering Pennsylvania as a result of the derailment or the controlled burn. In addition, all previously damaged train cars were removed from the tracks. Based on this information, the governors of Pennsylvania and Ohio announced on February 8 that residents may return to their homes and no longer need to shelter in place. There are no long-term air quality concerns related to the derailment.Additional Information

UPDATE: East Palestine Train Derailment













In regards to the train derailment in East Palestine Ohio....The creeks affected by the train derailment eventually lead into the Ohio River, beyond where we draw our water.  The Beaver River and the Beaver Falls Municipal Authority are not directly impacted.  However, we collect VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) source water samples weekly and are monitoring for any changes.Thank YouThe Beaver Falls Municipal Authority WATER SAMPLE UPDATE  -  See AttachmentsTHM's are always present in disinfected water.  Trihalomethanes (THMs), which were detected on the tap, are a result of a reaction between the chlorine used for disinfecting tap water and the natural organic matter in the water.   These are tested bi-weekly in house, and regulated by the state quarterly.   The current total THM's (MCL) maximum contaminant level is 80 ug/L.    For more information regarding THM's please refer to the link below.  For information on VOC results, please click on the pdf attachments below. RIVERWISE MODULE 5 which talks about THMs

In 1845, North Sewickley's geographic size was reduced by the creation of three new townships Marion, Wayne, and Perry from it's territory.
