Longswamp Township

The area known as Long Swamp was settled as early as 1734 and officially erected into a township within Berks County, Pennsylvania in 1761. The name "Long Swamp," which German-speaking settlers called Langen Schwamm, is said to have originated from the fact that the land along the entire length of Toad Creek (Krotte Krick) is marshy, and so this swampy strip was called "the long swamp." Toad Creek is a tributary that flows eastward from near the borough (and one-time township village) of Topton, along the ridge, until it empties into the Little Lehigh Creek at its convergence point with the Swabia Creek in the Village of Lower Longswamp.
