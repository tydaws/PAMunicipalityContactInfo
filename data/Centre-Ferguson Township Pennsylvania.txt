Ferguson Township Police are available to assist you 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Please review these guidelines about when it’s appropriate to call the police and which number to call to reach an officer:When to Call 9-1-1When you need help or your gut tells you to report something, consider it an emergencyIf you need to report a crime, suspicious vehicles or activity, car crash, an injured person or animal, someone in harm’s way, or something you have witnessed, contact the police immediately. Don’t wait! Give the police the opportunity to apprehend the suspect, gather evidence now, and help when time is critical. Call 9-1-1 any time of the day or night to be connected with a 9-1-1 communications dispatcher. When it’s an emergency, an incident in progress, or something that just happened, 9-1-1 is the number to call to reach a police officer. The Centre County Emergency Communications Center will dispatch an officer to you. Information that needs to get to police as soon as possible will be delayed if you send an email, message the department through Facebook, or if you call the Ferguson Township Police Department administrative offices after hours and leave a message. In an emergency, please do not use email, Facebook, or after-hours phone messages.When in doubt about what qualifies as an emergency, please call 9-1-1. Should you need assistance in the vicinity of the Ferguson Township Municipal Building, the foyer remains open even when the building is closed. Anyone who needs police assistance may pick up the phone in the foyer and be connected with a 9-1-1 communications dispatcher, who will alert our police that you are there. When to Call Administrative OfficesWhen you need information about car safety seat checks or bike safety, or have a noise or animal complaint, consider that a non-emergency.If you’re certain you have a non-emergency and just need information, you can call 1-800-479-0050, which will connect you to a police officer in your area. The Ferguson Township Police Department suggests you add this 800 number to your cell phone contacts.For information during Ferguson Township business hours (8 am - 5 pm Monday through Thursday and 8 am – 4 pm Friday), you can call the FTPD administrative offices at (814) 237-1172. This is the number to call to obtain copies of accident reports, records checks, and parking permits.Please reserve communications by email or Facebook message for non-emergencies.Use our online reporting tool for non-emergencies.To submit an anonymous tip, you can use our form here.For ordinance violations such as grass that needs to be mowed or sidewalks that need to be shoveled, please contact our Ordinance Officer.If you have any suggestions for improving police communications, please email or call to let us know how we can help.
