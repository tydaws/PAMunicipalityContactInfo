Leaf Collection:
Beginning in fall 2022, the Township will implement a scheduled leaf collection. In the past, Public Works completed leaf collection on every street approximately once every two weeks. That afforded Township employees flexibility to deal with emergency needs, weather delays, and varying leaf volume. But that process left residents guessing when their leaves would be picked up. The new schedule builds in buffers to manage disrupting factors while allowing residents to better plan their leaf clean-up and curbside disposal. The 2022 leaf pickup schedule is below. Please check the website closer to the fall as the schedule could change. Please have leaves out by 7 AM on the Monday morning of your collection week. Collection will take place during that week. Don’t know your ward? Click here:
Week of 10/17 – Wards 2,3,4Week of 10/24 – Wards 1,5,6,7Week of 11/7 – Wards 2,3,4Week of 11/14 – Wards 1,5,6,7Week of 11/28 – Wards 2,3,4Week of 12/5 – Wards 1,5,6,7Week of 12/12 – final pass through all wards (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
Thank you in advance for your patience as the Township works to implement the schedule. There will be miscalculations and mistakes along the way. We will learn from them. Please thank your Public Works Department employees who brave the cold, rain, and snow to collect leaves.

Please keep your leaves at the curb but NOT in the street. Leaves in the street can cause safety issues as cars will swerve around piles into oncoming traffic, the leaves can create slippery conditions, and the leaves will wash into the storm drains and create blockages.
Please do not bag the leaves. They are sucked up by a leaf vacuum, so the bagging is not necessary.
No other yard waste, besides leaves, should be included in the piles. This will cause problems for the machines. The non-leaf yard waste is mulched at the Township’s leaf-site, whereas the yard waste is taken off-site. For that reason, yard waste and leaves cannot be co-mingled.
Please do not park vehicles in front of the leaf piles as the workers will be unable to collect them. They will not be able to return until the following week to collect them if something is blocking the pile.

At other times of the year, the Township will pick up bagged leaves the second Tuesday of the month, upon request.  The Township will also pick up bundled small twigs and brush.  Must be bundled in 2′ sections.  You must call the township building to schedule a pick up.
Yard Waste Removal

Yard Waste (except grass clippings and weeds), leaves in biodegradable bags (NO PLASTIC BAGS) and bundled sticks will be collected by the Township Public Works Department the second Tuesday of each month. You MUST call the Township in order to get on the list to have your yard waste picked up. Simply call 610-566-4516 Monday through Friday, 9 AM to 5 PM and provide your address.
Drop-offs will be permitted from 8 AM to noon on the first Saturday of the month and Mondays and Tuesdays from 8 AM to noon each week at the Township public works garage located at 5 W. Brookhaven Road, Wallingford.

Limbs and branches must not be greater than 3-4″ in diameter and no longer than 5′. They should be bundled together with twine.
All items must be placed at the edge of your property, curbside. The employees cannot come onto your property to pick up the items.
If you choose to bag items, they must be in biodegradable bags.
Logs, stumps, and branches larger than the parameters above WILL NOT be collected. You’ll have to arrange for a tree company or your trash hauler to take those items.

To schedule a pick up, please contact the Township Municipal office at 610.566.4516 by the Monday prior to the scheduled Tuesday pick-up.

Closing the Digital Divide14% of all Pennsylvania households do not have an internet subscription and 3.1% of Pennsylvanians live in an area where there is no broadband infrastructure.   Having access to the internet is not a luxury, it is a necessity. Everyone should have the ability to access the internet from home, no matter where their home is.   To help identify gaps, Delaware County has launched a new survey to collect data about the availability of internet service for both residents and business. The survey is now live at delcopa.gov/broadband.   The survey is expected to be available through January 14, 2022.
Avoiding Holiday ScamsThis holiday season, Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Pennsylvania State Police are reminding shoppers to be on alert for fraud and scams.   For a list of common scams to watch for and strategies you can use to protect yourself, click here.

Litter Action PlanLast week, The Department of Transportation and the Department of Environmental Protection released the state’s first-ever Litter Action Plan. The plan includes current initiatives and recommendations for state and local governments, the General Assembly, businesses, and the public to clean up the more than 500 million pieces of litter scattered throughout the commonwealth.   The plan’s goal is to reduce the amount of litter in Pennsylvania by 30 percent within the next five years.

Fire Marshal and Fire Department Information

Nether Providence Township Fire Companies 
South Media Fire Co. No. 1                                            Garden City Fire Co. No. 1
  
The two main missions of fire service personnel in Nether Providence Township are Suppression and Prevention.
Operating under the Suppression mission are the township’s two all-volunteer fire companies – South Media Fire Co. No. 1 (founded in 1922) and Garden City Fire Co. No. 1 (founded in 1944). Nearly 100 men and women from all walks of life participate in these two active companies.  Together, the two fire companies are often referred to as the Nether Township Fire Department.
Garden City Fire Company currently is led by Chief Pat O’Rourke, while Max Hopkins serves as Chief of South Media Fire Company. Roughly half of the township is covered by each company’s respective fire district.
Both companies have engines (pumpers), utility vehicles, and command vehicles.  Garden City operates the township’s ladder truck, while South Media has a heavy rescue truck used in motor vehicle accidents.
One member of the township’s Board of Commissioners serves as Fire Commissioner and is the liaison between the volunteers and the township government. Nether Providence Township contributes tax dollars to support  the two companies.  An annual fund drive also provides revenues, with monies raised shared by the two companies.  Both companies also make use of various state and federal grants.
Garden City and South Media also share revenue from Rose Valley Borough as both fire companies provide fire service to that community.
The Fire Marshal’s Office is the arm of the fire service charged with fire prevention as well as education, inspections and investigations. The office also is headquarters for the township’s  Emergency Management Agency.
Jack Gresch is the current fire marshal.  He has a deputy who assist him in investigations and inspections and an assistant who works on grants and fire prevention.
Thanks to two recent federal grants, the township’s award-winning fire prevention and education program has been greatly enhanced. “Hazard House,” a table top model, is being used to teach children and adults about good fire safety practices. A Sparky the Fire Dog suit also has been purchased for use with children’s groups. Video materials and smoke detectors also are available to the public.
The township has a small contingent of fire police officers who assist in traffic control as well as other duties at the scene of an emergency.
In accordance with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the state’s arm PEMA, Nether Providence Township has an emergency operations plan,  and individuals from the township’s departments and emergency services are ready to provide support in the event of a township-wide emergency.

Frequently Asked Questions
The following is a list of frequently asked questions regarding recycling in Nether Providence township.
Q.  Is the recycling program part of my regular Township tax bill?
A: Yes.
The Township Board of Commissioners has created a recycling fee rebate program to offset the cost of the recycling program for our elderly lower income residents. The criteria used to qualify for the recycling fee rebate are the same as used in our existing sewer rent rebate option: residents 65 years of age or older with an annual income of less than $18,000. Please call or visit the Township office or visit the Township website to obtain a rebate request form.

Q. Why should I recycle?
A. Recycling saves energy, reduces pollution, and preserves natural resources.  So be part of the solution – Recycle!

Pennsylvania state law requires municipalities like Nether Providence to operate recycling programs.  Township residents can recycle two ways – by using the township’s curbside collection program.
Q. Does the township earn money for the items we recycle?
A. Yes. The township receives Performance Grants from the State of Pennsylvania based on the amount of waste recycled within the Township each year.


Q.  Does the Township recycle electronics?
A. Electronics cannot be recycled in the curbside recycling. However, the Township will occasionally work with surrounding towns to hold electronics recycling events. Check the news feed for info on upcoming events. Additionally, another resource is Retrievr (formerly “Curb My Clutter”). The link can be found here: Retrievr

Q. Can all glass be recycled?
A. No.
All glass food and beverage containers can be recycled.  The following types of glass cannot be recycled: Drinking Glasses, Mirrors, Ceramics, Crystal, Light Bulbs, Ovenware, Window Glass.
Q. Can all food cans be recycled?
A. Yes.
Q. Do I need to do anything to “prepare” my recyclables?
A. Rinse out glass and metal containers to avoid attracting pests.  Labels can be left on.  Remove all can or bottle lids.
Q. What is considered hazardous waste?
A. Some trash is hazardous and needs special handling. Delaware County offers Household Hazardous Waste drop-off collection several times per year.
Any item that has any of the following warnings on the label should be discarded at a household hazardous waste collection event:

Danger
Caution
Warning Hazardous
Toxic
Poison
Flammable
Combustible
Corrosive Explosive
Reactive

For information on the Delaware County HHW drop-off program, contact the Delaware County Recycling office at 610-892-9716 or www.co.delaware.pa.us/recycle.
Q. How do I recycle used motor oil, antifreeze or car batteries?
A. These products are harmful to the environment if they are discarded with your household trash or dumped in the street or storm drain.  These items are collected for recycling at many garages and auto repair sites.  For a list of facilities that recycle these products in Delaware County, visit:  www.co.delaware.pa.us/recycle/auto.html 
Q. When does leaf collection occur?
A.  Rake leaves to the edge of your property for collection between early November and mid-December. Please keep the leaves out of the street (the police department has reported numerous hazardous conditions in regards to leaves blocking the roadway) to prevent leaves from clogging storm water sewers and from obstructing parking or traffic flow. It takes about two weeks to complete each circuit of collection along the Township’s streets at the height of leaf season.
Q. Does the township collect yard waste?
A. Yard waste (except grass clippings), leaves in biodegradable bags (no plastic) and bundled sticks will still be collected by the Township’s Public Works Department the second Tuesday of each month. You can request pickup of these items by contacting the Township office at (610) 566-4516. You must schedule an appointment for items to be picked up.
Q. Does the township collect Christmas trees?
A. The Township will collect trees placed curbside during the first three weeks in January.  Simply remove any decorations or plastic.
Q. How do I dispose of heavy trash?
A. Please call your trash hauler.
Q. Does the township provide mulch?
A. Residents can pick up free leaf mulch at the Township Recycling Center (5 W Brookhaven Rd); or for a modest fee, you can arrange for home delivery of a full or half truckload of leaf mulch. Contact the township office for information on mulch delivery.
Q. How can I dispose of latex paint?
A. Please see the link by clicking Latex Paint flyer.
Q. How can I dispose of home healthcare waste?
A. Please see the link by clicking here: Healthcare Waste Disposal
Commercial Establishments – Recycling Information
In compliance with the Pennsylvania Mandatory Recycling Law – Act 101, Nether Providence Township is required to annually inform Commercial, Municipal and Institutional groups within its boundaries of their obligation to provide for the recycling of ALL cardboard, ALL grades of paper, clear, brown & green glass, ALL grades of plastic, bi-metallic & aluminum cans generated within their establishments as well as the requirement to compost ANY leaf waste or yard waste generated.
Each Commercial, Institutional and Municipal establishment within Nether Providence Township MUST provide for its own collection and transportation services of the items mandated for recycling.
The Township provides a drop-off center at the Township Garage, 5 West Brookhaven Road. Drop-offs will be permitted from 8 AM to noon on the first Saturday of the month and Mondays and Tuesdays from 8 AM to noon each week.
If you elect NOT to use the Township Recycling Facility you MUST submit to us at the end of the year documentation of the WEIGHT of the materials which your establishment has recycled.  I am enclosing a form to be completed with information as to who you contract with to haul away your recyclables.
Your participation is vital to the continued success of our recycling program.  If you have NOT been recycling in the past, let me encourage you to participate and be part of the solution.
