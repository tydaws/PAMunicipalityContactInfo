Business Registration Notices Issued
Jan 27, 2023In late 2020, the Board of Supervisors adopted an Ordinance establishing a Business registry. The registry will provide Township staff with the required information as may be needed for emergencies as well as code compliance! No Impact Home Based Businesses and Home Occupations are exempt from these requirements. A more detailed description is below along with links to the form of required information and our current fee schedule.
In order that the Township may best perform its services for the benefit of the community and the businesses therein, a centralized registry of all businesses is hereby established. Every person who shall first commence to engage in or conduct any business within the Township at any time after the first day of January of any year shall register such business within 30 days of the commencement of such business and pay the full registration fee as set by Resolution of the Board of Supervisors, provided that, when such initial registration shall take place in the month of December of any year, such registration also shall be applicable for the calendar year ensuing; provided, further, that every person who shall continue to engage in or conduct any business within the Township, at any time after the first day of January of any year shall have reregistered said business no later than the first day of March of said year and shall pay the full re-registration fee as set by Resolution of the Board of Supervisors. The initial registration or subsequent registration of a business shall be upon a form furnished by the Township, and the person shall pay the registration or re-registration fee, as the case may be, at the time of the registration or re-registration.
When any person registered under this article shall change their place of business within the Township, shall remove such business to a place outside the Township, shall discontinue such business, or shall transfer the business to any person, they shall furnish the information of such change, removal, discontinuance, as the case may be, within 10 days after the same, to the Zoning Officer, so that the register of businesses may be changed accordingly. Upon any change of ownership of any business which shall have been registered under this article, the new owner thereof, within 10 days after the acquisition thereof, shall furnish such information to the Zoning Officer, so that the register of businesses may be changed accordingly.

2023 Budget Adopted – Real Estate Tax Set
Dec 26, 2022The Board of Supervisors have adopted the 2023 budget. General Fund expenditures are up approximately 8%, the largest part of this increase (6%) is our curbside recycling collection contract which will increase by $330,000 for 2023. Also included in the draft budget is the addition of one (1) police officer and a modest increase to the Boone Area Library. The budget required a small tax increase of .25 mil which equates to $25.00 per $100k of assessed value.
In addition, a concern was raised about a funding crisis in the EMS arena, the Board was asked to consider funding a portion of the cost of operations within Amity. The 2nd Class Township Code states:  Section 1553. Emergency Services (a) The township shall be responsible for ensuring that fire and emergency medical services are provided within the township by the means and to the extent determined by the township, including the appropriate financial and administrative assistance for these services. After careful consideration, the Board agreed this is a vital service within the community and recognized the need to fund the same. The adopted budget also includes a dedicated.15 mil EMS tax for funding Emergency Medical Services, this equates to $15.00 per $100k of assessed value.
The total Township portion of your Real Estate Tax Millage for 2023 is 3.5 mil which equates to $350 for each $100,000 of assessed value.
On the sewer front, the major expansion/upgrade we announced last year is in the design stages, with the hopes of construction starting sometime in 2023. We have made application for grant funds to offset some of the expected cost. Sewer rates will remain at $140 per quarter at this time. Advance notice will be provided if that changes during 2023.

Fire & EMS Review and Recommendations
Nov 4, 2021Last November, the Board of Supervisors entered into a contract with VFIS to conduct an Emergency Services Assessment. As a result of this assessment, the report linked within this post outlines their analysis of the current status of Fire and Emergency Medical Services within Amity Township. Included within the report are various recommendations for the Fire Departments, EMS provider and Township to consider.  The Supervisors established a Committee to work through the report findings and to make recommendations to the Board of Supervisors for the improvements/enhancement of emergency services being provided in Amity.

Changes to Election Code Makes Voting More Convenient
Feb 10, 2020The Election Services Office would like to inform you about some very significant changes to the Election Code.
Act 77 Makes Historic Changes to PA Election Code
On October 31, 2019, Governor Wolf signed Act 77 of 2019 into law.  The Act is an historic election reform bill that makes the most significant improvements to Pennsylvania’s elections in more than 80 years. Act 77 allows more convenient and secure voting.  Most voters can now vote by mail-in ballot, and voters will have more time to register to vote and to return their absentee or mail-in ballots. There are a number of other improvements, click on the following link to learn more: http://www.co.berks.pa.us/De…/Elections/Pages/Act%2077.aspx…
PA voters can skip the lines on election day. Voters have two options for mail ballots, mail-in voting and absentee voting. If the voter does not qualify for an absentee ballot, they can apply for a mail-in ballot without a reason.
Absentee Ballot Application – http://www.co.berks.pa.us/…/Absentee_Ballot_Application%201…
Mail-In Ballot Application – http://www.co.berks.pa.us/…/ap…/PADOS_MailinApplication.pdf…


Don’t Forget to License Your Dog
Jan 3, 2020The Department of Agriculture is reminding dog owners to be sure they get a license.
All dogs three months of age and older are required to be licensed. The fee for an annual dog license is $6.50, or $8.50 if the animal is not spayed or neutered.
Lifetime licenses are available for dogs that have permanent identification such as a microchip or tattoo. Discounts are available for qualifying older adults and persons with disabilities.
Licensing dollars support the work of the Bureau of Dog Law Enforcement, which inspects Pennsylvania’s kennels and ensures the health and well-being of the dogs that spend their lives there; investigates and prosecutes illegal kennels and bad actors; protects the public by monitoring PA’s dangerous dogs and investigating dog bites; and reunites licensed lost dogs with their families and helps unlicensed lost dogs find shelter.
Pennsylvania dog licenses are available for purchase through Pennsylvania’s county treasurers. To ensure you’re purchasing a legitimate license and not being scammed, skip the search engine  and type www.licenseyourdogpa.pa.gov into your browser’s address bar find your county treasurer’s information.


Yard Waste / Brush Disposal / Christmas Tree Collection
Dec 23, 2019
The Yard Waste dumpsters, located at the Township Building have been relocated to the back of the parking lot across from the new Salt Shed.  Follow the new signage as staff will begin chipping evergreens and branches in the near future.  Beginning January 2nd, Christmas trees will be collected curbside and chipped for reuse at Monocacy Hill or other Township properties.  Our new chipper was purchased through a PA DEP Recycling Grant.


LOST or FOUND PETS
Nov 21, 2019If you find or lose a pet within Amity Township, please call the Township at (610) 689-6002 or after hours, (610) 655-4911. We will do our best to reunite the pet with its owner(s).  The Township has invested in a chip reader and we have established a short-term licensed holding pen.  We have a few resident volunteers helping us as well.  It is important to not only chip your pet; but to register the chip as well – please be a responsible pet owner!  If you use Facebook and are able to hold the found animal for a period of time, please post dogs to @BerksDogSearch as well as @Amity Township, Berks County, PA  For cats, please post to @BerksCountyCatSearch and @Amity Township, Berks County, PA  If none of the above are successful, we have entered into a contract with ACO Daywalt – they will only accept animals from Amity Township’s designated representatives – so again, please call US.


Updates to PA Fireworks Regulations
Jun 29, 2018
Do you have questions or concerns relative to the New State Regulations reagrding Fireworks selling, purchasing & use?  Please see the summary below prepared by the Township’s Code Officer.  After reading the same, should you have enforcement concerns, please contat the Police Department at (610) 655-4911 – of course, if it is a serious matter, please call 911.
As of October 2017, the Pa State Laws regarding fireworks underwent some significant changes. You are now going to see the availability to purchase and use larger and louder fireworks (i.e. Consumer fireworks). Here are some significant facts about the laws and the new changes:

All fireworks licensing is administered and enforced by the Pa Dept. of Agriculture
Fireworks are generally categorized in 3 types:

Novelty (the small basic stuff that has always been allowed)
Consumer (the bigger, louder ones that can go up in the air)
Display (the big ones you see at fairs and large events and the fire company is present)


The standard Novelty Fireworks and only the following Consumer Fireworks can be sold at the temporary fireworks tents all over the State:

Helicopter, Aerial Spinners
Roman Candles
Mine and Shell Devices (not exceeding 500 grams)


All Consumer fireworks can be purchased at permanent licensed facilities in the State. Examples of these are:

Sparklers
Cylindrical Fountains
Cone Fountains
Illuminating Torches
Wheels
Ground Spinners
Flitter Sparklers
Toy Smoke Devices
Wire Sparkler/Dipped Sticks
Aerial Devices such as

Sky Rockets
Bottle Rockets
Missile-Type Rockets
Helicopter, Aerial Spinners
Roman Candles
Mine and Shell Devices
Aerial Shell Kits




Regulations for the Use of consumer fireworks are as follows:

A person who is at least 18 years of age may purchase, possess and use consumer fireworks.
A person may not intentionally ignite or discharge Consumer fireworks:

on public or private property without the express permission of the owner.
within, or throw consumer fireworks or sparkling devices from, a motor vehicle or building.
into or at a motor vehicle or building or at another person.
while the person is under the influence of alcohol, a controlled substance or another drug.
within 150 feet of an occupied structure




Temporary fireworks tents may only sell fireworks between June 15 – July 8 and Dec 21 – Jan 2 of each year
Display Fireworks are not permitted to be sold or used in Pa without proper licensing from the Pa Dept. of Agriculture.
Any violation of the laws, whether selling or using illegal fireworks, is enforced by the Pa Dept. of Agriculture.
Pa State Police and Amity Township Police have the right to confiscate fireworks should a violation of the law be found.

Additional information regarding the new laws can be found at the Pa Dept of Agriculture


Radon Detection
Jan 16, 2017Testing Your Home for Radon
As part of national Radon Action Month in January, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) reminds residents that radon – a colorless, odorless, and radioactive gas — is a known human carcinogen and the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States.
Radon occurs naturally from the breakdown of uranium in soil and rocks and enters homes through cracks in the foundation or other openings. Due to its geology, Pennsylvania is prone to high radon levels, and has been detected in all 67 counties, with about 40 percent of homes having levels above national safety standards.
Winter is an ideal time to test, because doors and windows are generally closed, producing the most conservative results. High levels of radon tend to be found in basements, but the gas can be found anywhere in the home. Simple radon test kits are inexpensive and available at home improvement and hardware stores.
Amity Township has Radon testers available for use by Township residents. These units are calibrated prior to each use and left in your home for seven (7) days to ascertain if there is radon and record the level. There is a $200 security deposit to use the unit; and, we also ask for a copy of your driver’s license. Upon return of the unit, we return your check and shred your license copy. Should you be interested in using one of these units, please call Kathie Benson at the Township, (610) 689-6000, ext. #221. Be advised, there may be a waiting list.
For more information on radon, testing and daily tips, visit the Department of Environmental Department website.


Designated Internet Purchase Exchange:
Nov 21, 2016 Amity Township now offers a place for buyers and sellers from Facebook, Craigslist or any other means to meet when you don’t know the other party. The area is under video surveillance so your transaction will be recorded. The area is by the Myron Wheeler ball fields in the back of Police Department.
