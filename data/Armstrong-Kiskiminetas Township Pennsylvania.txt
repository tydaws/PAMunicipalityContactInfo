Roaring Run 




The Kiskiminetas River forms our southern border. Thanks to the decades of hard work by the Roaring Run Water Shed Association, there are many miles of scenic trails for walking, hiking, running, biking, and mountain biking. A boat ramp provides access to the river for canoeing, kayaking, row boating and fishing.
