Snow Removal
To help the public works department keep roads safe and clear of snow, take these simple but important steps:

Remove your vehicle from the road during a snow emergency, which is declared if there is over two inches of snow on the ground. Your vehicle may be towed if it is parked in the street.
Shovel snow from your driveway or sidewalk onto your front yard, not the street.
Shovel your sidewalk within 18 hours after the last snowflake falls. If you can't cut through the actual sidewalk, a two-foot wide path on the adjacent grass is permissible.
Keep non-essential vehicles off the roadways. Non-essential vehicles include 4-wheelers and snowmobiles.
Pile snow to the right of your driveway when you shovel.
Align your mailbox face with the back of the curb to avoid contact with the snowplows.
Remove trash and recycling receptacles, basketball nets, and all other items from the roadway to avoid damages.

Hatfield Township » Departments  » Safety & Code Enforcement  » Private Sewer Lateral Inspection



Effective January 1, 2022, the seller of any property connected to the public sewer system is required to have a video inspection of their private sewer laterals by a master plumber or utility contractor to be reviewed and approved by the Hatfield Township Municipal Authority before any transaction of real estate can take place and before any Use and Occupancy permit can be issued.

Inspections must be performed within 1-year prior to the sale of the home or business, unless the existing lateral is entirely approved SDR pipe installed within the past five (5) years, and has been inspected and approved by the Hatfield Township Municipal Authority’s Inspector. PA Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has strongly encouraged Hatfield Township to prioritize reducing the amount of inflow and infiltration (I&I) in its public sanitary sewer system.

I&I is when stormwater and groundwater enter a wastewater system. This water, which ideally should drain into the ground or be routed to storm drains, can easily overload wastewater systems – causing sewage overflows to creeks, backups in basements, and impaired operations, among other challenges.

Below you will find a copy of Hatfield Township Ordinance #696, and an infographic outlining the new inspection requirements.

Hatfield Township » Departments  » Police » Officer Chapman Memorial Scholarship Foundation





Since 2006, The Officer William J. Chapman Memorial Scholarship has
            honored a colleague of the Hatfield Township Police Department by
            financially assisting graduating high school seniors with the next level
            of their educational goals.
Members of the Hatfield Township
            Police Department who wished to honor their friend and co-worker’s
            dedication to public service could think of no better way to cultivate
            the ideals held by Officer Chapman than by assisting students who have
            chosen to pursue a career that personally invests their efforts and
            talents back into their communities. Graduating high school seniors
            seeking an undergraduate degree in a public service-oriented field such
            as criminal justice/law, education, social work, or medicine are
            eligible to apply for this scholarship.
The scholarships are
            awarded following a selection process that includes interviewing each
            applicant. Through 2022, 71 graduating seniors residing within the North Penn and Souderton Area school districts  have been the recipients of this scholarship.
The Officer William
            J. Chapman Memorial Scholarship Foundation, Inc. was incorporated in
            2009 as a 501(c)3 non-profit organization (as defined by the Internal
            Revenue Service). The scholarship is funded solely by donations and is
            overseen by an all-volunteer board of directors.
