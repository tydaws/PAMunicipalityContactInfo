Assessment Appeals









General Information
 




Special COVID-19 Meeting Arrangements
Due to COVID-19, the Board of Property Assessment Appeals and Review has made arrangements for all 2023 hearings to take place telephonically. Learn more about how the process works with the BPAAR Telephone Hearing Tip Sheet and COVID-19 Regulations Tip Sheet included with your scheduled hearing notice.









2022 Second Filing Appeals
Please note that filing a 2023 appeal will only affect your 2023 value and is not retroactive. 

 Read more in the news release.

                
BPAAR Policies for new 2022 appeals





Property Assessments can be appealed by the property owner or any taxing body with a vested interest in the parcel.
 The appeal is heard by the Board of Property Assessments Appeals and Review (BPAAR). 
This is the first level of appeal available to owners and taxing bodies. 
If the BPAAR disposition is unsatisfactory to any of the parties, they may

    Appeal the BPAAR Decision to the second level, at the

    Court of Common Pleas, with the the Board of Viewers (BOV).
 These are independent bodies, each with their own governing bodies and rules.
More details are available on the following BPAAR appeal topics below:

Appeal of an Assessed Property Value 
Appeal of a Special Assessment
Pre-Hearing Preparation
Hearing Day Logistics
Hearing Day Process Outlined

 
Vital Information for Appeals

 Confirm receipt of your appeal form.

        
If you submitted a paper application, check the

                 Real Estate Website or call us at 412-350-4636 (INFO) Option 2.
 If you submitted the form via email, you should have received an email receipt within 2 business days of submission.

            
 If you submitted online, you should have received an email copy of your form within 30 minutes of submitting it.


Prepare your evidence in support of your appeal. You may want to review our Appeals Tip Sheet
 for suggestions on preparation.
Submit your phone number to be called for the hearing FIVE days prior to the hearing date. 
Submit your evidence TEN days prior to your hearing date to the County, and also to the opposing parties.  
A special BPAAR Telephone Hearing Tip Sheet and COVID-19 Regulations is included in your hearing notice with details on submitting evidence.
Your hearing notice may arrive while you are on vacation or away from home.

        
If you have not made arrangements through your local post office for your mail to be forwarded, periodically call 412-350-4636 (INFO) Option 2, to check on the status.

                


 Hiring an attorney to represent you is your choice.

        
Legal representation is not required.
However, most school districts and municipalities will have legal counsel present.

                


Someone else can represent you for the appeal.

        
Appoint an authorized representative to file your appeal and represent you at the appeal hearing.

                


If you cannot attend the scheduled hearing.

        
 You may                                                                                                                            

 Request a One-time Postponement (at least seven days prior to the hearing date).

                
Must be in writing at least seven days before the scheduled hearing date.
Emergency requests also must be made in writing and must be faxed, emailed or hand-delivered, with contemporaneous notice to all

                        parties.

                    


 You may

                Appoint an Authorized Representative of your choosing.




Appeal withdrawal.

        
Only the filing party can request withdrawal of an appeal by completing and submitting a BPAAR Withdrawal Form.

                


Attending a hearing for an appeal filed by the school district or the municipality.

        
 You are not required to attend an appeal filed on your property by your school district or municipality.
 You may attend the hearing to present evidence for your case if you so choose.







Failure to Appear
If an appellant fails to attend a scheduled hearing without a timely request for a postponement, the appeal will be classified as withdrawn and the appellant will have no further right to appeal the assessment for the year at issue.

SANITARY SEWER ISSUES

									      Township sanitary sewer lines continue to be obstructed because of an increasing number of wipes, paper towels, and other materials being introduced into the sanitary sewer lines. Residents are asked to discard the materials in the trash rather than flushing them, placing the items in the basement floor drain, or in manholes. Continuing these practices may cause expensive sanitary sewer back-ups not only in your home, but in your neighbor's home as well. Residents are to contact South Park Township at 412-831-7000 with any questions or if they notice sewage smells or manhole problems.

PORTABLE STORAGE CONTAINERS/DUMPSTERS REQUIRING PERMITS

									      Ordinance No. 698 was adopted on May 11, 2020, for the purpose of regulating the use of portable storage containers, temporary dumpsters, and other refuse containers within the Township. Any questions concerning the use of portable storage containers/dumpsters, or to obtain a permit, please contact the Code Enforcement Office at 412-831-7000.

REFUSE AND RECYCLING COLLECTION
South Park Township contracts with Waste Management as the waste and recycling hauler for residents. Garbage will be collected once every week and recycling will be collected every other week, designated by street. Click here for a Trash & Recycling Calendar and street listing guide to identify your collection day. A Trash & Recycling Calendar insert is also available in the January edition of the Park News. Residents can view these guidelines by clicking here.

                        Residents are advised to place material at the curb after 6:00 p.m. on the prior day of your scheduled collection day. When your collection day falls on or after a major weekday holiday (New Year's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Day), your collection will be delayed one day that week only. If a holiday falls on a Saturday or Sunday, there will be no change in the collection schedule. For more information regarding refuse and recycling collection, visit the Refuse, Recycling and Sewage page.

TRASH & RECYCLING REMINDER TO OUR RESIDENTS:
Residents are reminded that trash and recycling containers are to be placed at the curb after 6:00 p.m. the evening prior to their collection day. The reason is that trash and recycling collection activities are not scheduled according to a specific time in a specific neighborhood. This means that just because trash was collected at 9:00 a.m. for the past month, it will be collected at the same time going forward. Collection times may vary for a number of reasons. Please make every effort to place all containers at the curb the evening prior to collection day.
RECYCLING BINS AND LIDS FOR SALE AT THE ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - Residents can purchase 32 gallon recycling bins for $16.00/each and recycling bin lids for $4.00/each at the Sewage & Tax Office located in the Administration Building.
