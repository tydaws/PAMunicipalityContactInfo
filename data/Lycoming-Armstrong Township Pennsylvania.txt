Find Assisted Living Facilities in Pennsylvania
Search 1,225 assisted living communities and homes


 












Are you looking for assisted living facilities in Pennsylvania where your loved one can age in place and live out the rest of their days in comfort and mild luxury? Then it may surprise you to know that the Keystone State is home to 1,220+ licensed assisted living communities.
Cost for Assisted Living Facilities in Pennsylvania
The statewide average for assisted living in the state of Pennsylvania is below the $4,000 national average at $3,750 per month.  The least expensive assisted living residences can be found in areas of Scranton and Gettysburg at a range of $2,400 to $3,463 per month. Pittsburgh’s assisted living facilities can be found for around $3,800 per month. The most expensive assisted living locations are in Erie, Harrisburg, Chambersburg, Lebanon and Lancaster at a range of $4,350 to $5,318 monthly.
The state of Pennsylvania has quite a range of facilities and locations to choose from. However, keep in mind that even the cheapest facilities do not count memory, dementia or Alzheimer’s care, post stroke or physical therapy care in their rates. It’s best to know the care needs of the senior in question to try and plan for an extra $1,000 or more tacked on to the base-rates reflected here if the senior has been diagnosed with some form of dementia or needs additional care not offered in basic rates.
Why Choose Pennsylvania For Assisted Living?
Pennsylvania could be the right place for your aged parent to retire in as it is not only filled with nature, but also very quiet. It is not a far commute to nearby big cities or main travel spots like New Jersey or New York.
So seniors with grandkids living in the neighboring cities can commute in and out without having any difficulty in enjoying the company of their loved ones. 
The weather at this Mid-Atlantic state is also moderate and pleasant with the four seasons, so your aged parent can age in place comfortably throughout the year.
If you are still wondering what other perks make Pennsylvania the perfect place for your loved aged one to enjoy assisted living, here are some of them:
Senior tax benefits
Pennsylvania is undoubtedly one of the best tax-friendly states in the U.S. Seniors with a pension, Social Security, or 401k income can take advantage of the benefits here.
Your aged loved one can stretch their retirement income even further in Pennsylvania as it has the lowest flat tax rate in the country at 3.07 percent. If your aged parent is over 65 years of age, they may even be eligible for a rebate on their housing costs, whether they own or rent. As a result, the seniors will be able to afford the expenses for assisted living facilities.
Extracurricular activities for seniors
The Keystone State is resplendent with historical sites, beautiful mountains, art scenes, and more. You will also come across lots of historic theaters and great museums. The assisted living facilities in Pennsylvania will host residential and recreational activities and excursions to such locations, so the seniors may learn more about their local attractions and count their steps for exercise.
Also, if your aged parent loves camping outdoors or still enjoys hiking, they can enjoy The Poconos in Northeastern Pennsylvania. The mountains in these regions are not only breathtaking but also offer lots of opportunities for many outdoor adventures.
High-quality Medical Care
Pennsylvania is renowned for its first-rate medical care facilities and hospitals. For instance, Penn State Hershey Medical Center – which is one of the best medical facilities in the region – is located in Central Pennsylvania.
Your aged one must have access to quality medical care as they will need check-ups more often for all health issues while they reside in an assisted living facility.
Seniors can have access to healthcare, attentive caregivers, as well as access to social opportunities or local activities at any of the assisted living facilities in Pennsylvania. They can also get help with transportation, housekeeping duties, meal services, laundry as well as 24-hour surveillance for maximum safety.
Do you still have doubts? Visit any of the assisted living communities of your choice in Pennsylvania and see if they offer care services that meet your senior care needs.
Regulations & Requirements for Assisted Living in Pennsylvania
The state of Pennsylvania has 2 different licenses for care homes that provide assisted living. Facilities can be licensed as either Personal Care Homes (PCH) or Assisted Living Residences (ALR). The licensing for these facilities is overseen by The Department of Human Services, Bureau of Human Services Licensing.  Personal care homes will serve those who have mental illnesses and other mentally challenging disorders, as well as physically challenged seniors. In order to be eligible to receive care in a personal care home, they must not need 24-hour skilled nursing services, which are offered in retirement homes in Pennsylvania. They must, however, need ADL assistance.
The senior living units in Pennsylvania personal care facilities must provide the resident 80 square feet of floor space. In double or multiple occupancy units, there must be 60 square feet per resident. This measurement does not include closets, alcoves, locker space, door swing or free-standing wardrobes or bathrooms. In each senior living unit in a Pennsylvania personal care facility, there must be room to pass between individual beds as well as the ability to use any ambulation equipment as well as oxygen equipment easily. Any other physical requirements are based on the safety of the environment, sanitary conditions and fire regulations. For assisted living residences, the square footage allowed for a single occupancy unit must be at least 225 square feet, not counting the non-livable space. For double occupancy, there must be at least 300 square feet.
Each assisted living unit must have a lockable door, unless a lock would endanger the senior in some way. There must also be medical alert systems to summon medical personnel.
For PCH: a maximum of 4 residents are allowed to share a senior care apartment unit. Only 2 seniors with dementia are allowed in a living unit, which is a secured specialized dementia care unit.
For ALR: no forced sharing allowed. No more than 2 seniors are allowed on their own volition. They must be mentioned in each of the roommate’s contracts with the assisted living residence, which means they can choose their own roommates.
For PCH: One toilet for every 6 residents or fewer. This includes the staff and residents in that number.
