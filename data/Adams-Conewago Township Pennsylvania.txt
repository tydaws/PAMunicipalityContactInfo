Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds










The Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) program authorized by the American Rescue Plan Act, delivers $350 billion to state, territorial, local, and Tribal governments across the country to support their response to and recovery from the COVID-19 public health emergency.  



Program recipients with questions about reporting, technical issues, eligible uses of funds, or other items click here for self-service resources.
 
            Self-Service Resources
        

Through SLFRF, over 30,000 recipient governments across the country are investing these funds to address the unique needs of their local communities and create a stronger national economy by using these essential funds to:  
Fight the pandemic and support families and businesses struggling with its public health and economic impacts
Maintain vital public services, even amid declines in revenue resulting from the crisis
Build a strong, resilient, and equitable recovery by making investments that support long-term growth and opportunity
The Final Rule for the program took effect on April 1, 2022. Recipients and stakeholders are also encouraged to consult the Overview of the Final Rule, which provides a summary of Final Rule provisions for informational purposes, the Final Rule Frequently Asked Questions, which provide additional guidance on how recipients can use funds, and for Tribal governments, the Tribal government fact sheet, which contains highlights of the final rule relevant to Tribal governments. For more details,  visit the Final Rule section below.
Use of Funds
Recipients may use SLFRF funds to:
Replace lost public sector revenue, using this funding to provide government services up to the amount of revenue lost due to the pandemic
Respond to the far-reaching public health and negative economic impacts of the pandemic, by supporting the health of communities, and helping households, small businesses, impacted industries, nonprofits, and the public sector recover from economic impacts
Provide premium pay for essential workers, offering additional support to those who have and will bear the greatest health risks because of their service in critical sectors
Invest in water, sewer, and broadband infrastructure, making necessary investments to improve access to clean drinking water, to support vital wastewater and stormwater infrastructure, and to expand affordable access to broadband internet
The Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds provide substantial flexibility for each jurisdiction to meet local needs within these four separate eligible use categories. For questions about how the end of the COVID-19 National Emergency impacts these uses of funds, please see FAQ 4.11 in the Final Rule FAQs.
Final Rule
Funding from the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds is subject to the requirements specified in the Final Rule released by Treasury on January 6, 2022. Treasury released an Overview of the Final Rule, which provides a summary of major rule provisions to assist recipients and stakeholders.
The Final Rule takes effect on April 1, 2022, though recipients can choose to take advantage of its flexibilities and simplifications now. Recipients may consult the Statement Regarding Compliance with the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds Interim Final Rule and Final Rulefor more information on compliance with the Interim Final Rule and the Final Rule.
The Final Rule builds on the program’s successes and implementation efforts so far. In May 2021, Treasury published the Interim Final Rule (IFR) to govern eligible and ineligible uses of funds (as well as other program provisions), sought feedback from the public on these program rules, and began to distribute funds. The IFR went immediately into effect in May, and since then, governments have used SLFRF funds to meet their immediate pandemic response needs and to begin building a strong and equitable recovery.
As governments began to deploy this funding in their communities, Treasury carefully considered the feedback provided through the public comment process on the Interim Final Rule and in other forums.  Treasury received over 1,500 comments, participated in hundreds of meetings, and received correspondence from a wide range of governments and other stakeholders.  On January 6, 2022 , Treasury released the Final Rule, which delivers broader flexibility and greater simplicity in the program, responsive to feedback in the comment process.
A few core improvements included in Final Rule are:
Broader set of uses that are available to respond to the pandemic’s public health and economic impacts on households, small businesses, and others, including capital expenditures
Major simplification for thousands of recipients through the $10 million revenue loss standard allowance
Greater flexibility in eligible broadband investments to address challenges with access, affordability, and reliability, as well as the addition of numerous eligible water and sewer infrastructure investments 
More streamlined options to provide premium pay through broadening the share of eligible workers who can receive premium pay without additional justification
RESOURCES ON DETERMINING ELIGIBLE USES OF FUNDS UNDER THE FINAL RULE
The Final Rule provides the rule text and supplemental information.
The Overview of the Final Rule provides a summary of major rule provisions for informational purposes and is intended as a brief, simplified user guide for recipients and stakeholders.
The Final Rule FAQs provide responses to frequently asked questions regarding the use of funds under the Final Rule.
The Department of Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development partnered to create the Affordable Housing How-To Guide The purpose of the guide is to assist recipients in implementing their funds for affordable housing. It provides a summary of relevant SLFRF guidance and provides information on ways recipients can combine different sources of federal funds.
The Statement Regarding Compliance with the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds Interim Final Rule and Final Rule  provides guidance on the transition from compliance with the Interim Final Rule to compliance with the Final Rule.
Tool for Determining Low and Moderate Income (LMI) Households  provides a spreadsheet to assist recipients in determining income thresholds for the Final Rule’s definition of LMI in their jurisdiction and assist with administering the public health and economic response provisions of the Final Rule.
The Final Rule webinar and slide presentation provide an introduction and summary of the Final Rule.
