Resident Information


Because of our Community Pride, you’ll find Vanport Township the perfect place to call home. Vanport Township sits next to Beaver Borough, and the two combined areas provide a wonderful small town atmosphere with all the necessary conveniences. Below are some informative tidbits for Vanport Township residents.
VANPORT TOWNSHIP MILITARY BANNER PROGRAM:

Vanport Township has always taken great pride in the men and women who have served our country in its times of need. Now we’d like to take this opportunity to invite you to help us honor your friends and family who have served our great country.
The Military banner Program salutes our brave men and women who are currently serving and those who have served in the military by creating and displaying a 24 X 36” military banner to be exhibited between Memorial Day and Veterans Day for years to come.
For the application and more information please visit:http://www.troopbanners.com/vanportTwp
 
 
RESIDENTS – ALERT! 
We have seen an increase in scams throughout Beaver County and in the Vanport Township area.  Be alert, especially during these difficult times as scammers may try to take advantage of you. They might get in touch by phone, email, postal mail, text, or social media. Protect your money and your identity by not sharing personal information like your bank account number, Social Security number, or date of birth with anyone.
Telephone scammers try to steal your money or personal information. Scams may come through phone calls from real people, robocalls, or text messages. Callers often make false promises, such as opportunities to buy products, invest your money, or receive free product trials. They may also offer you money through free grants and lotteries. Some scammers may call with threats of jail or lawsuits if you don’t pay them.
Be safe and if you feel that you may have been scammed, please report it to the proper authorities.

Recently the township has seen an increase in individuals dumping grass, leaves and other items along the township park on River Avenue and on property owned by Norfolk and Southern Railroad. It is illegal to dump any items on these properties and there could be fines and possible criminal prosecution for violations. Please click the link below for more information:

RESIDENTS: The street is NOT for yard waste disposal. (With the exception of leaves during the Fall leaf pick-up period) What is put there ends up in the storm drain system. This can cause clogging, which then causes the water to back up and seek other flow paths which may cause damage to roads or property. ( See ‘NEWS’ tab for more information on Stormwater Discharges from the Township small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Or, check eCode 145-5)
