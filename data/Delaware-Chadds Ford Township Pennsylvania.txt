Tax Information










 
Chapter 116 of the Chadds Ford Township Code governs the assessment and collection of Township Taxes in addition to Property Taxes. Information on this web page is for reference only. State and Township Codes provide the specifics of each tax.
Township Real Estate Tax:
Landowners in Pennsylvania pay three separate annual taxes on their real property: County Tax, School Tax and Township Tax. At the bottom of this page you will find contact information for the County and School District tax offices. The Township collects only the last and smallest of these three and Chadds Ford residents enjoy one of the lowest township tax rates in the region: less than 1 mil!
The 2023 Chadds Ford Township tax rate is 0.5252 mils. Some properties enjoy fire hydrant service and those parcel owners pay an additional 0.067 mills for a total of 0.5922 mils.
Below is a breakdown of our tax structure and a sample calculation:

2023 Millage


General Fund:

Fire Hydrant Service        


 
.3520
.0072
.0670


Open Space Fund


.1660


Total Real Estate Tax Millage
With Hydrant
Without Hydrant


 
.5922
.5252


Millage (or mils) is 1/1000th of the ASSESSED value of your property collected as a tax. To calculate, take your ASSESSED value and divide by 1000 then multiply by the millage rate. Please note that ASSESSMENTS are set by the County.
SAMPLE CALCULATION
If your home is ASSESSED at $150,000:
Standard $150,000 ÷ 1000 = 150 x 0.5252 = $78.78
Fire Hydrant Service $150,000 ÷ 1000 = 150 x 0.5922 = $88.83
