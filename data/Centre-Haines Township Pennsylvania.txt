Haines Township is a rural second-class township in central Pennsylvania, located on the eastern edge of Centre County, and is approximately 30 miles east of State College (home of Penn State University).
Haines Township covers a large area of diverse landscapes including mountainous terrain with sandstone ridges, mature forestlands, wetlands, limestone caves, and portions of several Exceptional Value streams and their watersheds. The Bald Eagle State Forest occupies the southern and eastern portions of the township and a small southwestern portion of the township lies in Poe Paddy State Park. Starting in 2023 Haines Township will take over as host of the Dutch Fall Festival.    This will known festival is held in Aaronsburg, Haines Township, Centre County annually on the first full weekend in October.
