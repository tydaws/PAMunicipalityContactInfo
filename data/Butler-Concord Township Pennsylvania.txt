Real Estate TaxesIn Concord Township, property owners receive three different real estate tax bills each year. Concord Township tax bills are mailed February 15th. Delaware County tax bills are mailed February 1st. Garnet Valley School District tax bills are mailed July 1st. Real estate taxes are based on a millage rate which is determined by each of these governing bodies each year.
In 2023, the millage rate for Concord Township is 0.514 mills (or 0.453 without Fire Hydrant Tax). Delaware County’s tax rate is 2.999 mills. Garnet Valley School District’s fiscal year runs from July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023 and the millage rate for this period is 18.6866.  

How are real estate taxes calculated?Real estate taxes are calculated by multiplying the local millage rate (property tax rate) by 1/1000th of the assessed value of the property. To calculate, take your ASSESSED value and divide by 1000, then multiply by the millage rate.
*Please note: Property assessments are set by the County.*Sample Calculation of Concord Township tax:
If your home is assessed at $150,000:$150,000 ÷ 1000 = 150 x 0.514 = $77.10
Who is responsible for paying real estate taxes?All owners listed on the deed of a property are legally responsible for paying the full amount of the real estate tax.Failure to receive a bill does not alleviate you from the responsibility.Original tax bills are mailed to the homeowner, not the mortgage company. If funds are held in escrow to pay real estate taxes, avoid duplicate or missed payments by checking with your lender to determine payment expectations. Failure to pay property taxes can result in a tax lien or foreclosure. If necessary, contact the tax collector for a copy of the tax bill.
