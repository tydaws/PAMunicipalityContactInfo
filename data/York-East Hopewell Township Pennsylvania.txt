We love helping our customers! So how can we help your business thrive?








 PCLC’s partnership with the dynamic marketing team at Higher Information Group has dramatically impacted our students, supporters, donors, and sponsors. They helped us target our greatest assets, and the results have been outstanding. For example, our latest fundraising campaign goal was to raise $25,000. Thanks to some hard work and our incredible collaboration with HIG, we are quickly closing in on $40,000. We couldn’t have done it without HIG, and we could not be more grateful.
Leslie H., Perry County Literacy Council 






 Moving to HIG to manage our Google Grant was the best decision we made. Not only are the reports easy to understand, but the HIG team takes the time to truly strategize and collaborate in order to use Google ads to their fullest potential.
Carla F., Central Pennsylvania Food Bank 






 The HIG Design Team takes our ideas and makes them WOW! They demonstrate imagination, skills and experience when transforming tentative briefs into elegant brand identities and campaigns.
Jason V., Greystone Public House and Greystone Brew House 






 The team at HIG understands our business strategy and built a fresh, new site designed to support our objectives. They have been a pleasure to work with and very responsive! They handled design and content and made the transition to a new website seamless!
Richard E. Jordan III, Smith Land & Improvement Corporation 






 I’m passionate about helping my clients plan for their future. I recognized the importance of digital marketing but creating and executing a campaign was outside of my expertise. Higher Information Group stepped in ready to hit the ground running. I’m beyond pleased with the results and look forward to working with them well into the future.

About Us

East Hopewell Township is a municipality located in York County.HISTORY:A petition signed on May 5, 1883, was presented to the court at York, presided over by Hon. John Gibson, asking for a division of Hopewell into two townships. The reasons given were that many of the electors were required to go a long distance to the voting places. It was claimed that great convenience would result from the division of the township. It was decided, however, that it was best to divide Hopewell into three townships. This is the beginning of the three townships known as Hopewell, East Hopewell, and North Hopewell. The division became official in June, 1885.

About Us

East Hopewell Township is a municipality located in York County.HISTORY:A petition signed on May 5, 1883, was presented to the court at York, presided over by Hon. John Gibson, asking for a division of Hopewell into two townships. The reasons given were that many of the electors were required to go a long distance to the voting places. It was claimed that great convenience would result from the division of the township. It was decided, however, that it was best to divide Hopewell into three townships. This is the beginning of the three townships known as Hopewell, East Hopewell, and North Hopewell. The division became official in June, 1885.
