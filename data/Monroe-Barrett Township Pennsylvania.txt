Barrett Township is located in northern Monroe County, Pennsylvania. Nestled in the beautiful Pocono Mountains of northeast Pennsylvania, Barrett Township is a growing community of approximately 4,000 full time residents. With the presence of several popular tourist destinations, resorts, and a thriving commercial and business community, the population present in the Township on a daily basis can often swell to many times that number.Barrett was formed in 1859 from portions of both Paradise Township and Price Township. The Township is bordered on the south by Paradise Township, Price Township to the southeast, and Coolbaugh Township on the west. Barrett Township is bordered by Greene Township in Pike County to the north, and Porter Township in Pike County to the northeast.Barrett Township consists of 5 villages: Cresco, Mountainhome, Canadensis, Buck Hill Falls, and Skytop. Each village represents the original settlement areas within the Township and is serviced by it's own United States Post Office.Barrett is close enough to the more populous areas of the county to be conveniently accessible, yet it's position within Monroe County provides for a more "small town" sense of community and makes it a great place to live, work, play, and raise a family.
