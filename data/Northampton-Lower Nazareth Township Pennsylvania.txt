The History of 



Lower Nazareth 



Township 



The History of Lower Nazareth Township 










					Gently nestled in rich Eastern Pennsylvania farmland, it was originally part of the “Walking Purchase” of 1737. Purchased from William Penn, this area was originally known as “The Drylands”. This 83 hundred-acre section was once thought to be doomed and was termed, “Barren”. There was very little forest land as the Indians had burned all of the vegetation to drive the game into the open to hunt. This “Barren” appearance of the area gave rise to the popular superstition that no crops could be grown in this region as it was too “dry”. Early residents held a rich religious heritage and named Lower Nazareth Township after the biblical town of Nazareth. In 1740 it was written, “The surface of the township is level; the soil limestone, and well improved by judicious course of crops, and careful culture, and very productive”. In 1807, Lower Nazareth was created. Learn More

What is the Board of Supervisors? 




Lower Nazareth Township is governed by an elected body organized under the Second Class Township Code of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. That Board is called the Board of Supervisors and consists of five (5) elected officials, each serving a six (6) year term.The Board of Supervisors is charged with the general governance of the township to secure the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the Community. To accomplish that task the Board adopts laws, known as ordinances, which govern various activities within the Township.The Board may appoint a Township Manager who is charged by the Board with implementing the ordinances it passes and managing the annual budget of the Township which is adopted by the Board each December for the following calendar year. 




How Board of Supervisor Meetings Work 




The Board of Supervisors typically meet on a twice monthly basis to conduct business on behalf of the Township. All meetings of the Board are open to the public with an opportunity at each meeting for public comment.If a resident has a concern he or she feels needs to be addressed within the Township, the individual is encouraged to contact the Township Office. Many times, issues can be addressed by Township Staff, however if an appearance before the Board is necessary, time may be scheduled to present concerns to the Board of Supervisors. Residents are encouraged to present their views on Township matters on any of the means available, including written or electronic communication or by telephone. The Township Staff strive to facilitate your communication with the Board of Supervisors.

The elected Board of Auditors consists of three members, each elected to a six year term. Typically, the Board of Auditors conducts the annual audit of township finances, except when an independent auditor has been appointed by the Board of Supervisors, which is the case in Lower Nazareth Township. The Elected Board of Auditors also set the compensation of supervisors when employed by the township as road masters, road superintendents, road laborers, or as secretary or as treasurer.

This Commission is a five-member advisory body to the Board of Supervisors. Each member serves a six-year term. The Planning Commission meets on the third Monday of each month. This Commission makes recommendations to the Board of Supervisors on development plans submitted to the Township, suggests modifications where needed, and recommends appropriate actions. The nature of local government requires that the Board of Supervisors dedicate itself to the many issues of day-to-day operations and the details of land use can often be lost in the mountain of important, but time-consuming demands. The Planning Commission, as an independent advisory body, gives the Board of Supervisors the assurance that the important issues of land use and future growth are given the necessary attention.

The Zoning Hearing Board has no legislative power; therefore it can neither make nor modify zoning policy. The Zoning Hearing Board does not have enforcement powers. It is a quasi-judicial body; that is, its powers are to some extent judicial in nature. The board schedules hearings on applications and appeals that come before it, takes evidence, and issues written decisions with findings of fact and conclusions of law. A ZHB must limit its scope of activities to those permitted by the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (MPC) and by the local zoning ordinance.The primary purpose of the Zoning Hearing Board is to help assure fair and equitable application and administration of the zoning ordinance by hearing appeals on the zoning officer’s determinations and by granting relief from the literal enforcement of the ordinance in certain hardship situations. The Board consists of a three-member Board with two alternate members. All members of this Board are appointed by the Board of Supervisors and serve five year terms. They meet on demand, the fourth the Tuesday of each month.

The History of 



Lower Nazareth 



Township 



The History of Lower Nazareth Township 










					Gently nestled in rich Eastern Pennsylvania farmland, it was originally part of the “Walking Purchase” of 1737. Purchased from William Penn, this area was originally known as “The Drylands”. This 83 hundred-acre section was once thought to be doomed and was termed, “Barren”. There was very little forest land as the Indians had burned all of the vegetation to drive the game into the open to hunt. This “Barren” appearance of the area gave rise to the popular superstition that no crops could be grown in this region as it was too “dry”. Early residents held a rich religious heritage and named Lower Nazareth Township after the biblical town of Nazareth. In 1740 it was written, “The surface of the township is level; the soil limestone, and well improved by judicious course of crops, and careful culture, and very productive”. In 1807, Lower Nazareth was created. Learn More
