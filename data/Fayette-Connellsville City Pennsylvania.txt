Welcome Visitors!

Thank you for choosing us as your new home or vacation spot!

Mayor Lincoln Welcomes You!

   Great schools, miles of trails and grand river frontage, a farmers' market featuring local vendors, parks with playgrounds, good roads, safe neighborhoods and caring people.  These are just a few of my favorite things about Connellsville.

    Connellsville is decidedly pro-business, spurring an incredible amount of development recently including a new hotel, new retail businesses and restaurants.  Yet we retain a small-town feeling, evidenced by numerous events throughout the city, held throughout the year.  

     If you have any questions please don't hesitate to call us at city hall.  (724) 626-2020.

     Thanks for choosing Connellsville as your home or vacation spot!
