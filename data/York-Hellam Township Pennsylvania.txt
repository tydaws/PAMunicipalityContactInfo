OLDS Facts:
In November, 2004, the Hellam Township Board of Supervisors adopted an (OLDS) On Lot Sewage Disposal System Ordinance, No. 2004-3, as part of compliance requirements to Pennsylvania's Act 537 Plan and to the Township's DEP approved Act 537 Plan. The primary objective of Pa. Act 537 is to protect above and below ground water from contamination through effective maintenance programs for on-lot sewage disposal systems and other sewage disposal systems. Because approximately 70% of Township residents rely on wells and springs as their primary source of drinking water, effective maintenance of on-lot sewage disposal systems is extremely important. This ordinance establishes an OLDS maintenance program which complies with DEP guidelines to ensure Pa. Act 537 compliance. A summary of each property owner's responsibilities under the Ordinance is:
The ordinance requires property owners to have their septic tanks pumped out and inspected at least once every four years based on the following schedule:
District 1  is all properties in the area bounded by the Susquehanna River, US Route 30, Hatchery Road, Rudy's Road, Codorus Furnace Road and the Codorus Creek.
District 2  is all properties in the area bounded by the Susquehanna River, Lower Windsor Township municipal boundary, Ducktown Road, Walnut Springs Road, and US Route 30.
District 3  is all properties in the area bounded by Springettsbury Township municipal boundary, US Route 30, Walnut Springs Road, Ducktown Road, and the Lower Windsor municipal boundary.
District 4  is all properties in the area bounded by Springettsbury Township municipal boundary line, the Codorus Creek, Codorus Furnace Road, Rudy's Road, Hatchery Road and US Route 30.
After the above schedule is completed, the schedule rotation will start over again to ensure proper maintenance and compliance to State law and the Township's ordinance.
When you arrange to have your system pumped, you should contact one of the approved pumper/hauler/inspectors licensed to operate within Hellam Township.  Licensed pumper/hauler/inspectors are responsible for providing both property owners and the Township with a detailed report of each system that they pump. Pumper/hauler/inspectors are also responsible to fill out both forms, the York County form and the Hellam Township form.
