Mission Statement and Information


Mission Statement:
The Sewickley Township Parks & Recreation Department offers diversified recreational services to its residents. It is the desire of the department to improve the quality of life for each individual and the community as a whole, and to offer the most efficient and professional services by providing and maintaining parks and recreation facilities for use by the general public.
Having home field advantage is a benefit to any team. So, when it comes to Sewickley Township residents looking for a place to go for a summer swim, outdoor picnic or playground fun, there’s no need to go far.
We have a recreational hub in the heart of the township with Crabapple Lake Community Park and Crabapple Lake Community Pool, the five adjacent baseball/softball fields, John C. Bruno Memorial Football Stadium, and three playgrounds.
For more than 60 years, Crabapple Lake Community Park has served the community in many ways. Anglers can be found casting their lines at the lake throughout the season. Two pavilions and restroom facilities, nestled among the tall oak trees, have hosted plenty of reunions, graduation parties, and family events through the years. And over at the swimming pool, both young and old gather daily to enjoy the lazy, hazy days of summer. The public pool is open, weather permitting, seven days a week during the summer. Season passes are sold to individuals, offering a great price for a summer’s worth of fun. Discounts are given to senior citizens as well.
Also, during the warmer months, plenty of children can be found on the baseball and softball fields where the hometown teams practice and host games. A nearby playground helps to entertain the younger children while their bigger brothers and sisters take to the fields.  There are also playgrounds in the Villages of Hutchinson and Lowber.
The Sewickley Township Recreation Committee Volunteer members plan events for the community.  Annual events are the Father/Daughter Dance, the Easter Egg Hunt, Rabies Clinic, and the Halloween Trunk-or-Treat.
