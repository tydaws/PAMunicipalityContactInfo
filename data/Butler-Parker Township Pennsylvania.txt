Sgt. William Tims has been patrolling Norristown since Julius Erving was the Sixers MVP.Justin Heinze, Patch StaffPosted Mon, May  15, 2023 at 12:24 pm ETReply (Shutterstock)NORRISTOWN, PA — It was a different world when the Norristown police force was last without the services of Sgt. William Tims. It was 1985, the Iran-Contra fair had just begun, the Reagan administration was at its height, the Sixers resident MVP was Doctor J, and along the banks of the Schuylkill there was...less. For the next 38 years, with a steadfastness that his peers called the definition of duty, loyalty, and service, Sgt. Tims helped to keep the citizens of Norristown safe. The police department honored Tims on Monday, noting that he was ending his long and distinguished career as an officer."Sgt. Tims demonstrated an unshakable commitment to the core principles of law enforcement, earning the admiration and respect of his colleagues and the community he has served," the department said in a statement. "Sgt. Tims has been a mentor, a leader, and a friend to many. As we bid farewell to Sgt. Tims, we are reminded of the countless lives he has touched and the many citizens whose safety he has ensured through his selfless service."Find out what's happening in Norristownwith free, real-time updates from Patch.SubscribeThe department added that Tims left a "lasting legacy that will continue to inspire us all."Amongst numerous awards and honors, Tims was recently commended, along with other officers, for "teamwork, bravery, and dedication to duty in excess of the norm" in the capture of an armed robber.Find out what's happening in Norristownwith free, real-time updates from Patch.SubscribeGet more local news delivered straight to your inbox.

Meanwhile, recently-installed Democrat Jamila Winder has only been in office for a year and has several Democratic challengers.

Only five will advance to the general election.  The only other contested primary at the county level is the register of wills. Democrats Tina Lawson of Upper Dublin and Hilary Fuelleborn of Jenkintown will face off to determine who will face Republican Cheryl Bonavita of Franconia in the general election.Some Norristown precincts will see a vote for magisterial district judge in 38-1-16. Antonio Maturano and Hakim Jones are cross filing and will appear on both ballots. One seat on the Pennsylvania state Supreme Court is up for grabs, and both Democrats and Republicans have several candidates lined up. In November, the winner will be the best way to take the political pulse of the state ahead of 2024. Two Democrats are running, Deborah Kunselman and Daniel D. McCaffery, as well as two Republicans, Patricia McCullough and Carolyn Tornetta Carluccio. Democrats currently have a 4-2 majority on the seven-person board.There are no statewide referendums or ballot questions in this year's primary. Election security Law enforcement in Montgomery County are preparing for the upcoming primary election, laying out this week to the public their plan to protect voters and the legitimacy of the eleciton.  See more: Montco DA, Detectives Prepare To Respond To Primary Election Fraud The District Attorney’s Office and the Montgomery County Detective Bureau have established a special election tip line, and they're urging residents to be watchful for anyone attempting to vandalize ballot drop boxes, do anything suspicious surrounding the boxes or polling places. “I want to reassure Montgomery County residents that we will use all means tomake certain we have a safe, secure and valid election here in Montgomery County, for both in-person voting on Election Day and for voting by dropping off completed paper ballots between now and May 16,” First Assistant District Attorney Edward F. McCann Jr. said in a statement. “If the facts and evidence warrant it, we will prosecute anyone who attempts to interfere with this election.”In addition, the county has allocated a special team of prosecutors and detectives to answer complaints, allegations of fraud, and any other "irregularities." While these preparations occur at the county level before each election, activities undertaken to protect basic democratic processes have been under a microscope since related unstability wracked the nation in 2020. Sample ballot If you want to see exactly what you'll see on your ballot, Montgomery County Voter Services offers sample ballots for each precinct online here. If you're voting by mail Voting by mail was available to all Pennsylvania voters prior to Election Day.Ballots are due back to a designated ballot drop-off location by 8 p.m. Tuesday night. Most counties have drop boxes set up around the county, and also accept ballots at elections offices. If you still haven't received your mail-in ballot and Election Day arrives, you can also vote via a provisional ballot at the polls. The provisional ballot will become your official vote once elections officials determine they have not received your mail-in ballot.RELATED: Montco To Install 12 Mail-In Ballot Drop Off Boxes For Election The box locations are listed below: CheltenhamTownship Tax Office8230 Old York Road, Elkins Park, PA 19027 LansdaleDistrict Court 38-1-28430 Pennbrook Parkway, Lansdale, PA 19446 Lower MerionLudington Library5 South Bryn Mawr Ave, Bryn Mawr, PA 19010Norristown – Airy Street LotMontgomery County Airy Street Parking LotCorner of Airy and DeKalb Streets, Norristown, PA 19401 Norristown – One Montgomery Plaza425 Swede Street, Norristown PA, 19401Starting May 6, 2023, this drop box will be available on the following schedule: Weekdays: 6 a.m. until 11 p.m.Saturday & Sunday: 6 a.m. to 10 p.m.Election Day: 6 a.m. to 8 p.m.PottstownMontgomery County Office of Public HealthSouth Hall, 364 King Street, Pottstown, PA 19464 Royersford2nd & Arch St Parking LotVictory Park Parking Lot, 251 2nd Street, Royersford, PA 19468 (near the Electric Vehicle Charging Stations, home of the Royersford Farmer’s Market) SkippackMontgomery County 4H Center1015 Bridge Road, Collegeville, PA 19474Upper DublinUpper Dublin Library520 Virginia Drive, Fort Washington, PA 19034 Upper FrederickGreen Lane Park Office2144 Snyder Road, Green Lane, PA 18054 Upper MerionUpper Merion Township Building175 W.
