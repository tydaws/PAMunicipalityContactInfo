Welcome to East Nantmeal 

East Nantmeal has a rich heritage and has long been recognized as a great place to live. The nearly 1800 residents of our 16.4 square mile township enjoy the beauty of large,  sweeping views of rural landscapes with numerous historic structures, including iron furnaces, mills, school houses and other features of architectural significance. Within its borders, our township encompasses working Century farms as well as new residential communities.
More than anything else, our township takes great pride in its stewardship of the land and its unique sense of community. We are fortunate that over half our township has been preserved. Our citizens appreciate and treasure this special place.
Sincerely,
East Nantmeal Board of Supervisors
