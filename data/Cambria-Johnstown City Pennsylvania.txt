An Additional funding opportunity that just became available to small businesses, below. 
(The City has no affiliation to this program, therefore we cannot answer any questions).
Pennsylvania 30 Day Fund
The Pennsylvania 30 Day Fund provides forgivable loans up to $3,000 to small businesses in need.
Pennsylvania businesses that qualify for assistance from the Fund are:

For-profit small businesses that employ three to 30 people;
Based in Pennsylvania and have been operating for at least one year;
Owned and operated by a Pennsylvania resident.

The funds dispersed to small businesses by the Pennsylvania 30 Day fund do not need to be repaid.  If businesses who receive the Fund’s assistance do, at a later date, wish to “pay it forward” to another Pennsylvania small business in need of assistance, they may do so by directing those dollars back to the Fund, which will disburse the funding to another Pennsylvania business in need.
The application can be submitted from the applicant’s phone in less than 10 minutes
 Approvals occur within 3-5 business days, approved businesses can expect an immediate transfer of funds

Welcome to the City of Johnstown, a progressive community in southwestern Pennsylvania.
      




Located in the Laurel Mountains of Pennsylvania, Johnstown had a colorful history as a booming steel town in the 1800s. We have great connections to neighboring communities and beyond, as well as an airport that offers daily flights to Washington and Greyhound and Amtrak train service.
Johnstown is home to nearly 22,000 and our family-friendly neighborhoods, good schools, and superb quality of life are just a few of the reasons why our residents have chosen this area as their home.
We invite you to come and see for yourself all that Johnstown has to offer. Once you get here, you won’t want to leave!
People move to Johnstown for many reasons: our excellent schools, first-rate health care facilities, scenic beauty, tourism, and proximity to Pittsburgh.
Families that left our city years ago are moving back to Johnstown to enjoy a lifestyle that offers convenience, affordability and a community spirit that can’t be found in larger cities.
Our surrounding communities offer many specialty shops. You can also take a historic walking tour of our downtown…visit the Flood Museum and learn a lot about the Great Johnstown Flood that killed more than 2,200 in 1889. Although it’s a story of great tragedy, it’s also one of inspiration and triumphant recovery … and one that has helped shaped who we are today.
