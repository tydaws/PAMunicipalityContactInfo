Asbestos Information
Asbestos is a generic term used to describe a variety of natural mineral fibers.  Because asbestos, in certain forms, has been determined to cause serious health problems, the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) regulates the removal, collection, transportation and disposal of asbestos-containing materials.  The building must be thoroughly inspected for ACM prior to any renovation or demolition.  Notification for projects in Pennsylvania are submitted on the ―Asbestos Abatement and Demolition/Renovation Notification‖ form.
