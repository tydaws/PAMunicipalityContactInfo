Real Estate Tax InformationEarned Income Tax InformationLocal Services Tax InformationAmusement Tax & Mechanical Device Tax InformationRealty Transfer Tax InformationPROPERTY TAX REBATE PROGRAM: On May 24, 2022, the Methacton School Board voted to approve Resolution 22-02. This resolution provides tax relief for qualifying individuals based on Chapter 13 (Senior Citizens Property Tax and Rent Rebate Assistance) of the Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of Special Session 2006, 53 P.S. §6926.1301, et seq. Click here for more informationThe Per Capita Tax has been eliminated as of July 1, 2020. Click here to view Ordinance 667, repealing the per capita tax.Working from Home May Affect Your Local Wage TaxIf you are an employee of a Philadelphia-based employer and are now required to work remotely from your residence in Lower Providence, you should inquire with your employer about withholding the appropriate earned income tax. If you have been and continue to be required to work from home for 90 or more days, your employer could register your home as a work location and no longer withhold the Philadelphia wage tax.Instead, your employer could be withholding at the rate applicable to your new work location – your Lower Providence residence.  This means that you would then be taxed at Lower Providence Township’s lower earned income tax rate of 1%.  Additionally, the tax revenue would come back to your home community of Lower Providence Township as well as the Methacton School District thus benefiting both of your taxing districts. Again, this must be initiated by the employer so if this applies to you, please inquire with your employer to see if this could apply to your 2021 Earned Income Taxes.

PennDOT Ridge Pike & Germantown Pike Intersection Re-Alignment ProjectPennDOT is in the design process for a project in Lower Providence Township that is part of a plan to improve travel and safety on both sides of the bridge carrying Ridge Pike over the Perkiomen Creek into Collegeville Borough. Under this project, PennDOT will realign and reconfigure roadways and intersections on either side of the bridge. The re-alignment of Route 29 (1st Avenue) in Collegeville was completed with the Royal Farms development. In Lower Providence Township, the Ridge Pike and Germantown Pike intersection will be eliminated and a new alignment tying Germantown Pike into Ridge Pike further east of the current intersection will be created.Construction is anticipated to begin late summer 2024.A presentation on the proposed project, previously known as the Perkiomen Creek Crossing Project, was made at the May 6, 2021 Board of Supervisors meeting. Questions on the project should be directed to Nathan Parrish, P.E., Consultant Project Manager, at c-nparrish@pa.gov.The May 6, 2021 presentation materials and are below:Ridge Pike & Germantown Pike Intersection Re-Alignment ProjectProject OverviewQuestionnaire/Comment Card Previously, PennDOT hosted an open house on Nov. 4, 2018, to introduce the proposed improvements.

The Township has secured a $1 million grant from PennDOT to perform the preliminary engineering and final design for the project. This is a great example of an intergovernmental partnership that works to benefit the community. We will continually provide progress updates on this web page.Progress Update - August 2020 Progress Update - October 2019Progress Update - April 2019Progress Update - November 20, 2018Progress Update – June 18, 2018Progress Update - March 5, 2018Progress Update - February 8, 2018Progress Update - December 6, 2017Progress Update - October 10, 2017Progress Update - August 7, 2017Progress Update - June 8, 2017Progress Update - May 3, 2017Progress Update - April 7, 2017Progress Update - March 6, 2017Progress Update - February 7, 2017Progress Update - January 5, 2017Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer Authority Middle Interceptor ProjectThe Lower Perkiomen Valley Regional Sewer Authority (LPVRSA) has begun its Middle Interceptor Project. The project is the final component of the plan to expand the Perkiomen Creek Interceptor. Questions or concerns about the project should be directed to the LPVRSA Manager Michael McGann, (610) 676-9040. Click here for background and detailed description of the project.Currently, construction accesses which are complete and will continue to see some construction traffic are located in Collegeville at First Ave/Chestnut Street Ext. and in Upper Providence in the Yerkes area near Hopwood Road on RTE 29. A new access being used is in Lower Providence Township at the dead end of Yerkes Road. Land clearing and silt fence has been 100% installed from Collegeville to Yerkes Island and completed on Yerkes Island. The clearing crew is currently working in Lower Providence from Yerkes Road to Waterfall Circle. Clearing work includes removing trees and brush plus installation of silt fence.  Allan Myers, the construction company awarded the bid, will be conducting some excavation work in these areas for test digging. They will be using the former Stiefel Property, now LPVRSA property, next to the Arcola Road Bridge on Cider Mill Road. They will be working in that area clearing the Arcola Island (upstream from the bridge) and installing silt fence over the next several weeks. Work will continue upstream from there onto Pfizer’s property. Next crews will move back onto Yerkes Island and work upstream toward Collegeville preparing to install pipe and manholes. The preparation will include blasting and hammering rock if necessary.  All of the blasting will be conducted in accordance with PA state laws. The blasting is scheduled for the end of September through October.  Pipe and manhole installation will follow in this area with the goal of completion in January. The silt fence will remain after pipe installation because the contractor will have to return at a later date to tie-in the connections to the new interceptor.

Snow Removal Information





 


 

The Public Works Department counts on your cooperation to help us maintain roads during inclement weather. Please remember:It is almost impossible to keep snow from being deposited at driveways during plowing. Click here for a helpful tip.Do not place snow from driveways into the streetPlease clear snow from around fire hydrants on your propertyDuring plowing, keeping main roads open and passable is the first priority. As soon as all major roads are clear, equipment is moved immediately to residential areas. Because they carry the lowest volume of traffic, cul-de-sacs and dead-end streets are the last plowed.State and Montgomery County roads are cleared by their own crews.  Click here for a list of these roads and contact information.State law requires that vehicles be completely clear of snow and ice and headlights be on when windshield wipers are in use.Mailbox DamageIt’s possible that some residential mailboxes will be damaged during a snowstorm. If damage is caused by snow or ice hitting the mailbox or due to deteriorated materials, repair or replacement is the resident’s responsibility. If it is determined that damage is caused by the Township plow truck striking the mailbox, the Township will provide $100 toward a replacement. If you believe that damage to your mailbox is the result of direct contact with a plow truck, please call the Public Works Department (610-635-3525) within 48 hours after the storm has subsided. The Township will evaluate the damage to determine responsibility.Adopt-A-HydrantIf there’s a fire hydrant outside your home or place of business, please consider taking the time to maintain it in the event of snowfall.   A clear, 3-foot path on all sides makes hydrants easier to locate and can save precious time in an emergency.What About Sidewalks?Property owners and tenants of properties bordering public streets are required by Township Ordinance to thoroughly clear a pathway at least 30 inches wide in the sidewalk within 48 hours after it stops snowing.  In ice or sleet events, tenants/owners are required to cover the sidewalk with ashes, sawdust or similar materials. Placing snow in the roadway or gutter is prohibited (Ordinance 120-34).Snow Removal: What You Need to KnowSnow Removal Brochure
