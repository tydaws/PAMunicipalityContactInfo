Page ContentCOVID-19 VaccinesVaccines are safe and effective and the best way to protect  you and those around you from serious illnesses.All Pennsylvanians ages 6 months and older are eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Those aged 6 months to 18 years require a parental consent. Learn more about the 
   pediatric vaccine. 
CDC recommends that people ages 5 years and older receive one updated (bivalent) booster if it has been at least 2 months since their last COVID-19 vaccine dose. People who have gotten more than one original (monovalent) booster are also recommended to get an updated (bivalent) booster. Use this tool to determine when or if you (or your child) can get one or more COVID-19 boosters.

People who are moderately or severely immunocompromised have different recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines, including boosters.





Looking for a replacement COVID-19 vaccine card? We can help by sending you a record of your immunizations! Please visit the PA-SIIS page and complete the Authorization for Release of Immunizations Records Form.

The Chester Tax Collection Committee   (CTCC) recently appointed Keystone Collections Group to serve as the Earned   Income Tax (EIT) and Local Services Tax (LST) collector for school and municipal   taxing authorities within Twin Valley School District. This important change was   brought about under Act 32 of 2008. Act 32 requires municipal governments and   school districts in all Pennsylvania counties, except Philadelphia, to select a   single tax collector to serve the Earned Income Tax collection needs of the   political subdivisions.

What is SEIGMA?

	The University of Massachusetts Amherst School of Public Health & Health Sciences (SPHHS) has been engaged by the Massachusetts Gaming Commission (MGC) since 2013 to carry out a comprehensive, multi-year research project, believed to be the first of its kind, on the economic and social impacts of introducing casino gambling in Massachusetts. The project fulfills Section 71 of the 2011 Expanded Gaming Act, which requires the MGC to establish “an annual research agenda” to assist in understanding the social and economic effects of the introduction of casino gambling in MA, and in making annual scientifically-based recommendations to the Legislature. In 2019, the MGC issued a subsequent request for proposals and awarded the contract to the same team, effective January 2020.

	The study focuses particularly on problem gambling, but also examines a wide array of social and economic effects of expanded gambling in Massachusetts. In addition to SPHHS, other key members of the research team include the UMass Donahue Institute, which will lead the economic and fiscal impact research, and NORC at the University of Chicago, which has led general population data collection efforts for the SEIGMA study.
