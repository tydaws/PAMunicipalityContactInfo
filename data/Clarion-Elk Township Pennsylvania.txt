KEYSTONE COLLECTIONS GROUP
EARNED INCOME TAX COLLECTOR
The Chester County Tax Collection Committee (TCC) appointed Keystone Collections Group to serve as the Earned Income Tax (EIT) collector for school and municipal taxing authorities within Chester County. This important change was brought about under Act 32 of 2008.  Act 32 requires municipal governments and school districts in all Pennsylvania counties, except Philadelphia, to select a single tax collector to serve the Earned Income Tax collection needs of the political subdivisions within the county.
For additional information on Keystone Collections Group, please visit their website www.keystonecollects.com
Did you know the quickest way to get your refund is to file online? If you live and work in Pennsylvania, you can e-file on our tax administrator’s secure website, which is available 24/7 at www.KeystoneCollects.com.
Keystone Collections Group’s e-file is the easy, fast and secure way to file your tax return.  It lets you file your tax return when it is most convenient for you. You will need your W-2, your Social Security Number and any other income documents that may apply (such as a PA-UE or a Schedule C).
Keystone redesigned e-file to make it even faster and more user-friendly.
If you have questions regarding local tax filing, visit Keystone’s Frequently Asked Questions or call Keystone’s Taxpayer Helpline at 1-888-328-0565 to speak with a local, knowledgeable Taxpayer Service Agent. You can also email your questions 24/7 to Taxpayer Support. Taxpayer Service Agents try to respond to all online inquiries within three business days.
Taxpayers with earned income in 2015 are required to file a Final Tax Return by Monday, April 18.
