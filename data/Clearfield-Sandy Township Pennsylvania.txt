Sandy Township, Clearfield CountyPennsylvania Sandy Township was established as a second-class township in 1878, and it is governed by a five-member Board of Supervisors. It is home to a myriad of businesses, industrial parks, and an intermodal rail hub. A growing residential, commercial, and industrial community that encompasses 52 square miles. The 2020 census shows the total population of Sandy Township at 11,848, with 5,058 housing units; the largest municipality in Clearfield County. Within the borders of the township is a gated recreational subdivision known as Treasure Lake with a population of 3,861 and 2,034 total housing units.The township contains a 12-acre recreational park which offers rental pavilions, a playground, volleyball court, walking paths, a groomed and fenced baseball/softball field, concession stand, and full running water bathrooms. The park is open seasonally from May through October each year. During the seasonally open times, the park is unlocked and available from dawn to dusk and is attended part time by a maintenance official.In a constant effort to continue growing the economy of the area, Sandy Township has partnered with the City of DuBois and Falls Creek Borough to form the SDF Enterprise Zones within the state efforts of the Department of Economic and Community Development. Because of this state designation the SDF EZ group is afforded the ability to apply, on behalf of industrial and manufacturing businesses located within the EZs, for the competitive grant to loan program that they offer to provide businesses with very low interest loans for various projects. If you own a business currently in the Sandy Township, DuBois, or Falls Creek area or are looking to relocate to the area; check out the Economic Development department page for more information. We can help!

Tax Information 
















The local property tax levy is 18.25 mills.  Residents also pay property and other taxes to Clearfield County and the DuBois Area School District. Residents of the Treasure Lake community in the township also pay an annual assessment — $1350 this year — to the Treasure Lake Property Owners Association.


Of that 18.25 mills of property tax, general government will use 13 mills, 3.0 mills will go to fire protection, 1.0 mills will go to a Municipal Building Fund, 0.75 Mills will go to Highway Equipment, and one-half mill is dedicated to the DuBois Public Library. The Township also contributes money to the Regional Airport.


The municipal authority’s budget is supported by revenue from sewer and water service, not property taxes. Municipal authority funds cannot be used for anything other than supporting itself, and tax dollars cannot be used to supplement the municipal authority. Tax monies can only be used for water and sewer projects if they are for economic development, (ie: job creation).


For general information of how Sandy Township taxes you and how this money is used check out, Sandy Township’s Municipal Codes.
