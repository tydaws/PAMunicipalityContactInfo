Current Emergency Information











CURRENT EMERGENCY INFORMATION
There are currently no emergency situations in Nockamixon Township
Treat ALL downed wires as potentially energized. Be advised that a wire laying on the ground can be energized even if it shows no signs of arching. Do not walk in the area of downed wires. Downed energized wires can and will energize the ground area especially if the ground is already saturated. This could lead to serious injury and electrocution.
