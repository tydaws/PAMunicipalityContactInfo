Remembering Greg DeLuca
Mr. Deluca was a long-time resident of Patterson Township. Greg served the community in many ways. From January 1983 until December 2017 he worked for the Townships Public Works department. During that time, he held the role of Foreman for many years. Greg served as the Townships Zoning Officer for many years, beginning in 1989. In January 2020, Greg was elected as the Buildings and Grounds, Recycling, and Zoning Commissioner for the Township. He held this role until his time of death on February 6, 2023. During his time as Commissioner he was instrumental in securing a $216,000 grant to expand the Townships recycling program and for the installation of the digital sign at the fire hall. Greg will be missed by his wife Mary, sons Greg, Jr. and Eric and their families, as well as the many community members and friends he made throughout his time here.
