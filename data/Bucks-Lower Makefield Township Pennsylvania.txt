LMT Floodplain Management Ordinance & FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program


A presentation on our Floodplain Management Program can be viewed at https://lowermakefieldpa.swagit.com/play/11052020-988 or at the link below:
2020 Lower Makefield Floodplain Management Program
Get alerted about emergencies and other important community news by signing up for ReadyBucks, the official emergency alert system of Bucks County and Lower Makefield Township, PA.

LMT Floodplain Management Ordinance & FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program
At their July 16, 2016 meeting, the Lower Makefield Township Board of Supervisors adopted a new Floodplain Management Ordinance (Ordinance #396). The Floodplain Ordinance was prepared and adopted in accordance with the requirements of FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  The Ordinance can be viewed at the following links:
Chapter 200: Zoning
§ 200-53 Floodplain Definitions and General Provisions

 200-54 Floodplain Administration
 200-55 Identification of Floodplain Areas
 200-56 Floodplain Technical Provisions
 200-57 Floodplain Prohibited Activities with No Variance Granted
 200-58 Existing Structures in Identified Floodplain Areas
 200-59 Floodplain Variances

Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) are available for review at the Lower Makefield Township Municipal Building Monday-Friday 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., or can be searched for and viewed online at the FEMA Map Service Center: https://msc.fema.gov/portal
Flood Insurance Studies, Elevation Certificates, Letters of Map Amendment and historic Flood Insurance Rate Maps are also available for review.


 




Community Rating System Participation


On May 1, 2016, Lower Makefield Township was accepted into the CRS Program which will provide the opportunity for discounted Flood Insurance Premiums to the residents. At the May 18, 2016 Board of Supervisors Meeting, a FEMA representative presented a plaque to the Township commemorating the Township’s entrance into the CRS Program.
The CRS Rating of 7 qualifies the owners of homes and businesses mapped within the A and AE Flood Zone for a 15% discount on their Flood Insurance Policy premium upon renewal or the initiation of their policy.
 
Lower Makefield Township provides assistance to all property owners, lenders, realtors, and builders through the following services:

Help you determine whether parcels located in the Township are affected by floodplains
Review Flood maps and other information
Provide Elevation Certificate, flood depth and property data
Answer questions about flood insurance
Conduct site visits to assist with localized flooding issues
Answer questions about building projects in the floodplain

You should consider taking advantage of this service prior to offering any property for sale or for construction.  Stop by the Planning Department at the Township offices or call 267-274-1123 if you need assistance from our Professional Engineers or Certified Floodplain Managers.
The Bucks County Parcel & Floodplain Viewer contains GIS mapping resources that contain the following layers that are useful when evaluating a property:

Floodplains (FEMA)
Streams
Subwatersheds
National Wetlands Inventory (USFWS)
Parcels (tax data)
Municipal Zoning
Contours
Current and Historic Imagery



 





 




Flood Protection Information and Resources


The Bucks County Free Library Yardley-Makefield Branch now has the following FEMA Publications regarding Flood Protection available at the Front Desk and at the Township offices for viewing/borrowing:
Protecting Building Utilities from Flood Damage
Reducing Damage from Localized Flooding
Answers to Questions about the NFIP
Elevated Residential Structures
Above the Flood:  Elevating Your Floodprone House 
Protecting Manufactured Homes from Floods and Other Hazards


You should consider purchasing flood insurance if you are in a Special Flood Hazard Area.  Homes and businesses in high-risk flood areas with mortgages from federally regulated or insured lenders are required to have flood insurance.  For residents living outside an area of high risk, having flood insurance may still be a wise choice: More than 20 percent of flood claims come from properties outside the high-risk flood area.

Insurance Agent Referral Call Center. To sell flood insurance, your agent or insurer must participate in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). If your insurance agent does not sell flood insurance, you can contact the NFIP Referral Call Center at 1-800-427-4661to request an agent.
More about Flood Insurance. The website, www.floodsmart.gov offers clear, helpful information from the National Flood Insurance Program.
