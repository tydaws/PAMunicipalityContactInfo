PUBLIC NOTICE:  A copy of West Hempfield Township’s Revised Pollutant Reduction Plan for stormwater discharges of nutrients and sediment to local surface waters and the Chesapeake Bay will be available for public review and comment starting on August 1, 2022. This Plan includes stormwater system maps, existing pollutant loading rates, required pollutant reductions, proposed stormwater BMPs to achieve required pollutant reductions, funding sources, and operation and maintenance requirements. This plan is available for public inspection at the municipal building located at 3476 Marietta Avenue, Lancaster, PA between the hours of 8:00am to 4:30pm Monday through Friday. A public review and comment period shall begin August 1, 2022 and shall continue for 30 days. Comments must be made in writing and received by the Township on or before August 31, 2022.
ANNUAL STORMWATER BILLS FOR BILLING PERIOD OF 7/1/2022 - 6/30/2023 HAVE BEEN MAILED. 
For more information regarding Stormwater Fee please visit this page!
 

 
'Illicit Discharge' is the discharge of anything other than stormwater which flows directly or indirectly into the Township's storm sewer system.  If you witness an illicit discharge, please call the Township at 717-285-5554 or submit your concern online.
*CLICK HERE TO REPORT AN ILLICIT DISCHARGE*
PLEASE NOTE:  Most stormwater facilities in the Township are private, including stormwater basins, swales, ponds, and similar facilities.  This means the individual property owners or Homeowners Associations (in neighborhoods with one), are responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the facility.  The Township does NOT maintain these private facilities.  
The Township does maintain the inlets and pipes within the public right-of-way.
 
Storm Water Management - NPDES and MS4 Programs  
West Hempfield Township is actively involved in a variety of programs and initiatives to meet various state and federal requirements for clean water.

We need your help to make a positive impact on our environment and the water that is so important to us all.  Stormwater originates from rainfall and other precipitation that runs off of surfaces all over the Township - rooftops, streets, construction sites, lawns, fields, etc. Stormwater makes its way either along the surface or soaks into the ground. The surface water flows into swales, storm drains, and other natural water courses. As this water moved toward the streams and rivers, it will pick up loose things on the ground with it. This can include pollutants, sediment, leaves, trash, etc.

The Township is actively involved in meeting statutory permitting requirements under state and federal law. The water that soaks into the ground becomes part of the groundwater. For the residents who get their water from wells, or our public water supplies, this becomes your drinking water. The Township is therefore developing a variety of programs and strategies to enhance water quality through plantings, mowing strategies, implementation of stormwater management facilities and other "best management practices" (BMPs).
The Clean Water Act is the federal legislation that governs stormwater management. Stormwater point discharges to waters of the U.S. (pipes and drain pipes) are regulated using National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits.

In 1999, federal regulations extended coverage of the NPDES program to Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4’s) serving populations less than 100,000. West Hempfield Township is an MS4 community and as such is required to comply with the NPDES program. Under the NPDES stormwater program, the Township is required to develop a stormwater management program that provides the details of how the community will comply with the requirements of the permit. Permits are based on a framework of six minimum control measures:

MCM 1 - Public education and outreach
MCM 2 - Public participation and involvement
MCM 3 - Illicit discharge detection and elimination
MCM 4 - Construction site runoff control
MCM 5 - Post-construction storm water management in new development and redevelopment
MCM 6 - Pollution prevention and good housekeeping for municipal operations and maintenance

More information on this program is available from the Pennsylvania DEP website.

'Illicit Discharge' is the discharge of anything other than stormwater which flows directly or indirectly into the Township's storm sewer system.  If you witness an illicit discharge, please call the Township at 717-285-5554 or submit your concern online.
*CLICK HERE TO REPORT AN ILLICIT DISCHARGE*
PLEASE NOTE:  Most stormwater facilities in the Township are private, including stormwater basins, swales, ponds, and similar facilities.  This means the individual property owners or Homeowners Associations (in neighborhoods with one), are responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of the facility.  The Township does NOT maintain these private facilities. 
The Township does maintain the inlets and pipes within the public right-of-way.
 
Storm Water Management - NPDES and MS4 Programs  
West Hempfield Township is actively involved in a variety of programs and initiatives to meet various state and federal requirements for clean water.

We need your help to make a positive impact on our environment and the water that is so important to us all.  Stormwater originates from rainfall and other precipitation that runs off of surfaces all over the Township - rooftops, streets, construction sites, lawns, fields, etc. Stormwater makes its way either along the surface or soaks into the ground. The surface water flows into swales, storm drains, and other natural water courses. As this water moved toward the streams and rivers, it will pick up loose things on the ground with it. This can include pollutants, sediment, leaves, trash, etc.

The Township is actively involved in meeting statutory permitting requirements under state and federal law. The water that soaks into the ground becomes part of the groundwater. For the residents who get their water from wells, or our public water supplies, this becomes your drinking water. The Township is therefore developing a variety of programs and strategies to enhance water quality through plantings, mowing strategies, implementation of stormwater management facilities and other "best management practices" (BMPs).
The Clean Water Act is the federal legislation that governs stormwater management. Stormwater point discharges to waters of the U.S. (pipes and drain pipes) are regulated using National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits.

In 1999, federal regulations extended coverage of the NPDES program to Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4’s) serving populations less than 100,000. West Hempfield Township is an MS4 community and as such is required to comply with the NPDES program. Under the NPDES stormwater program, the Township is required to develop a stormwater management program that provides the details of how the community will comply with the requirements of the permit. Permits are based on a framework of six minimum control measures:

MCM 1 - Public education and outreach
MCM 2 - Public participation and involvement
MCM 3 - Illicit discharge detection and elimination
MCM 4 - Construction site runoff control
MCM 5 - Post-construction storm water management in new development and redevelopment
MCM 6 - Pollution prevention and good housekeeping for municipal operations and maintenance

More information on this program is available from the Pennsylvania DEP website.
