Well Span Ambulance Service Taking Over Northeastern Area EMS

Posted on: May 4th, 2023                         

Resident Flyer
The Township Board of Supervisors and staff were recently made aware that Well Span Ambulance Service is taking over Northeastern Area EMS effective May 1, 2023. The township was not involved with this change over and were clued in less than a month before the effective date. 
Quoted from the Resident Mailer: “If you have a current membership with Northeastern Area EMS which expires on May 31, 2023, WellSpan EMS is extending your coverage until July 31, 2023. At that time, a new membership program will be offered by WellSpan EMS, with a wider service area and affordable rate structure. Rest assured, there will be no lapse in your coverage!
In the coming months, you will receive a new membership brochure from WellSpan EMS with details on the program and how to subscribe. Our membership will run July 1, 2023, through June 30, 2024.”
Thank you for your understanding. 
Call 911 in the event of an emergency.

York County Hazard Mitigation Update

Posted on: March 20th, 2023                         

Click here for the Website and Surveys
Hazard Mitigation, HazMit, is action taken to reduce harm before a disaster.  HazMit saves lives, property, and money.
As the York County Planning Commission updates its HazMit Plan in 2023, we need to hear from municipal leaders, local organizations, and residents throughout York County.  High participation and community awareness means your community is better prepared for the next emergency.
All 72 municipalities in York county are required to participate in updating our HazMit Plan or risk losing opportunities for federal and state funding related to hazard mitigation.

PUBLIC NOTICE: In need of Emergency Management Coordinator

Posted on: January 6th, 2023                         

At this time East Manchester Township with intent to be in joint operations with Manchester Borough and Mount Wolf Borough is in search of an Emergency Management Coordinator to graciously volunteer their time and fill the position of EMA Coordinator.
The Northeastern Municipal Area Emergency Management Agency is formed with a group of citizens from East Manchester Township, Manchester Borough and Mt. Wolf Borough who volunteer their time and services to assist professional agencies during an emergency or in a crisis. They are the “customer service” telephone operators that work “behind the scenes” coordinating communication between agencies, assisting in getting the needs to the workers, which may range from fulfilling the needs of getting food and drink to emergency personnel during a lengthy call out or calling to arrange for specialized equipment and supplies needed on site.
If you are interested in assisting with this volunteer service, please contact Township Manager, Kristie Masemer, at 717-266-4279.

Department of Environmental Protection Begins 2023 Black Fly Suppression Program

Posted on: April 14th, 2023                         

From DEP Document
Harrisburg, PA – The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) began its 2023 Black Fly Suppression Program this week. The program involves aerial and backpack spraying on roughly 1,800 stream miles in 37 counties of the commonwealth.
“Pennsylvania is full of beautiful state parks, trails and forests. People across the Commonwealth should be able to enjoy nature without this seasonal pest impeding on their time,” said Acting Secretary of DEP Rich Negrin. “Our black fly suppression program ensures safe and effective treatment of the black fly species.”
This year, 48 rivers and streams spanning more than 1,800 miles will be monitored and treated as needed. Spraying activities will be performed both by helicopter and ground crews. The frequency will depend on weather and biological conditions. Treatments cannot occur during periods of heavy rain or when water levels are high as these conditions lower the effectiveness of the treatment and significantly increase the cost of the control operations.
DEP uses Bti, a naturally occurring bacterium, to treat the larval stage of four specific human pest black fly species. This bacterium degrades quickly in the environment and does not harm the aquatic ecosystem, birds, or other insects.
Prior to any spraying activity, DEP notifies county and local emergency management officials. Helicopters can be seen flying over waterways and ground crews using backpack sprayers off bridges and wading in streams conducting control operations on behalf of DEP’s Black Fly Suppression Program. Anyone concerned at the sight of a helicopter or ground personnel is encouraged to call their county emergency management office to verify that a black fly treatment is taking place in their area on that day.
