Monroe County is comprised of 16 townships and 4 incorporated boroughs with a combined population of approximately 169,000 residents. Three of the boroughs and all of the townships were settled in the 18th century. However, most were not incorporated until the 19th century. The oldest of all the municipalities, in terms of settlement, are Smithfield Township and the Borough of East Stroudsburg.Monroe County is served by four public school districts, each with its own elected school board. Additionally, the county has a number of private schools and the Monroe County Area Vocational Technical School. The East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania and the newly opened Monroe Campus of Northampton Community College are also located in Monroe County.The authority for the collection of all Real Estate taxes (County, Municipal, and School) is based upon the location of the property being taxed. Each municipality has an Elected Official that is responsible for the collections of all taxes for properties that are situated within that particular municipal boundary.The Property Number (Ex: 01.9.1.64) will assist you in determining what municipality or school district the particular property is located. Match the first two positions of the Property Number (Ex: 01.9.1.64) to the corresponding number listed on the listing to locate the appropriate Tax Collector.
