As required by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection’s (PA DEP’s) National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Individual Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4) Renewal Application, Butler Township has prepared and must implement a Pollutant Reduction Plan (PRP) for the Storm Sewershed of the Urbanized Area of Butler Township. The purpose of the PRP is to select Water Quality Stormwater Management Best Management Practices (BMPs) to be constructed within the Township to achieve a minimum 10% reduction of Sediment, a minimum 5% reduction of Total Phosphorus and a minimum 3% reduction of Total Nitrogen Pollutant Loads in pounds per year during a five (5) year time period.
The proposed PRP developed by Butler Township can be viewed at the Butler Township Municipal Building located at 83 Corporate Drive in Butler Township, Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. or by accessing the Butler Township Website at www.butlertownship.org. Written comments shall be accepted by Butler Township for thirty (30) days from the date of this Public Notice. A copy of the written comments will be attached to the Final PRP submitted to the PA DEP by Butler Township. Furthermore, Butler Township shall accept and make a record of any oral comments received at any public meeting or public hearing held by Butler Township during the thirty (30) day public comment period. All public comments, whether received orally at a public meeting, or written, will be considered in the Township’s Final PRP submitted to the PA DEP.

													Victim/Witness Information											







 

 



A successful prosecution in any crime requires the help of victims and witnesses. In addition, several agencies are available to support you though the legal process and help you though the event. In order to present the strongest case possible, we also ask that you do the following:

Provide the police, victim/witness advocates and District Attorney’s Office with your current address and phone numbers.
DO NOT post anything on social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, etc., even if your profile is set to “private.”
Do not discuss your case in public.
Immediately report anyone asking you not to testify or cooperate with police.
Do not speak with any attorney except those who expressly identify themselves as assistant district attorneys with the Luzerne County District Attorney’s Office. If there is doubt, obtain their name and call the DA’s office at 570-825-1674 or contact the investigating officer. Sometimes, unscrupulous attorneys may call the victim or witness and try to talk about the pending case.

A crime victim is eligible to receive information concerning the offender though Pennsylvania's Victim Notification Service program, known as PA SAVIN. The Luzerne County District Attorney’s Office participates in the program. Visit here for more information.
