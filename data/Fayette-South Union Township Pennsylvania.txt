South Union Township has taken another large step to expand our recreation program by planning the construction of a new Indoor Sports Complex.  We have outgrown the existing Recreation Center and it is now time to broaden our recreation horizon and address the community’s recreation needs. 
Part of our strategy to help fund this project is hosting an annual charity golf tournament.  We would appreciate your help by joining us on Saturday, June 10, 2022 as a participating golfer or become an important tournament sponsor by choosing from a variety of sponsorships and as an alternative make a cash donation. 
All funds received will be used to construct the new Indoor Sports Complex which will feature a new synthetic turf, activity rooms, exercise equipment, full concession stand, locker rooms and much more.  All contributions are tax deductible.
