Dreher Township, Wayne County, PA 



Dreher Township is a rural, residential community, beautifully located in the southeastern corner of Wayne County. It borders Greene, Lehigh, Sterling and Coolbaugh Townships.The Township has a total area of 15.1 square miles. As of 2018, the population was 1,364. Gifted with streams, lakes, ponds, beautiful hills, trees and meadows, you can enjoy foliage and wildlife in this peaceful and relaxing country setting. It is truly nature at its’ finest. Dreher Township is close to Lake Wallenpaupack which offers boating, fishing, and swimming and the Township is home to the GDS Fair which is held each year in late August.When in town, be sure to visit our large park, the Carlton Drake Memorial Park, which borders the Wallenpaupack Creek.  The Park hosts little league, soccer, scouting, a weekly farmers market during summer months, as well as private and community sponsored events. A concession stand supports events with a snack or beverage. You are welcome to walk our nature trail along the creek and through meadows to relax or just get some exercise.  Serviced by small businesses, possessing old architecture and some continuing old farm culture, Dreher Township welcomes you as we are constantly “working on a brighter future.”
