Government InformationTownships in Pennsylvania are designated first or second class depending on their population. Pennsbury is second class as are most townships in the state. The governing body is composed of three supervisors, elected for six-year staggered terms. They operate under the Second Class Township Code, the Municipalities Planning Code and various tax enabling acts.
Originally the only responsibility of a township was to keep the roads open for farmers and supervisors were called "road supervisors". Today, the township maintains 26 miles of roads with 34 cul-de-sacs. In addition to maintaining roads, the supervisors are now required to provide planning and zoning, emergency management and certain health related services.  Trash pick up is private.  You must contract with a supplier.  Most homes have on site wells for water.  However, the southern part of the township has the Chester Water Authority main running through it and the northern half (along Rt. 926) has Aqua PA water main available only in certain areas. 
Board of Supervisors
The board of supervisors sets policy, enacts ordinances and resolutions, adopts a budget and levies taxes. Since there is no separate elected executive the Board must also perform executive functions such as preparing the budget, approve expenditures and hire employees. They also make appointments to various boards and committees.
Other Officials
Right to Know Officer - Kathleen Howley - 610-388-7323  Right to Know Form
Other elected township officials are: tax collector (four-year term), three auditors (six-year terms) and a constable (six-year term). The duties of the constable, as prescribed by the Pennsylvania Constitution, are to open, close, and maintain order at the polls.
