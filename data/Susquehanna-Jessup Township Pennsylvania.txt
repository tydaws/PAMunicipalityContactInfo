 About Jessup  



 


 







 
In an effort to help protect stream health and aquatic life, we here at the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection
(DEP) would like to offer some helpful tips and (not so) gentle reminders on how to properly close swimming pools for the year. Whether you’re a private owner, manage a public pool or work for a pool
maintenance company, these reminders are for you!

Discharged pool water and waters containing chlorine or other chemicals can be detrimental to aquatic life if not handled responsibly. It is extremely important that
these waters are handled correctly. Pool waters must not be discharged to any storm sewer or land in which a storm sewer is accessible because runoff can cause fish kills and unsafe aquatic
conditions.

When draining a swimming pool this year, make sure to protect Pennsylvania by following these tips:

Pool water may be disposed of through the sanitary sewer system ONLY with municipal
permission.
Never dispose of pool water through a storm sewer, which will discharge to a
stream.
If lowering the water level of the pool, let it drain to a lawn to prevent it from
running off into a storm sewer.
If a sanitary sewer system is not available, water may be used for irrigation if it does
not run off the property or into a storm sewer.


And don’t forget: The discharge of swimming pool water to any waters of the Commonwealth without a permit is a violation of the
Clean Streams Law.
