The Township bills on a calendar quarterly basis for sewer rental, residential trash/recycling services and stormwater management fee for which payment is due by the last day of the first month of the quarter. A ten-percent penalty charge is assessed for late payments.
Payment by check may be mailed or hand-delivered to our office or placed in our drop box, located in front of the Municipal Building at the Administration Entrance.
The combined residential sewer rental, trash/recycling, and stormwater management quarterly fee will be $214.73, effective January 1, 2023. The commercial sewer rental fee per quarter is a minimum of $102.54.
The Township does not provide trash/recycling services to commercial establishments, hotels/motels, schools, mobile home parks or apartment buildings with six or more residential units. These properties are, however, required by Act 101 to recycle. For more information on recycling requirements for commercial properties, click on Commercial Recycling.
