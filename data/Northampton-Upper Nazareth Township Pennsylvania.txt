Volunteer Opportunities

Success of the Township government relies upon four components: elected leadership, volunteer assistance, staff implementation and citizen participation. As the Township’s governing board, the Board of Supervisors serves as its board of directors. it provides direction and focus to the Township and has responsibility for making policy decisions.
Volunteers provide advice to the Board of Supervisors and staff through a number of boards and commissions. Volunteers also provide an ongoing source of citizen input to Township policy and operational discussions. Our Boards and Commissions perform vital roles in making our democracy work at the community level.
By working with the Township and staff, board and commission members become familiar with the needs and problems of the community, and are given the chance to apply their own talents and experiences to improve the quality of life for the community. Membership is an opportunity for citizens to contribute and to make a difference.
