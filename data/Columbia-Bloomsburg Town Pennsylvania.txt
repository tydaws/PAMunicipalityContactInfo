Flooding Information 















 






Bloomsburg's Floodplain 



 











 The Floodplain in Bloomsburg was created by the Susquehanna River on the south and Fishing Creek on the north and west boundaries of the Town. Their levels rise and fall. When they rise above flood stage, they can cover up to 1/3 of the landmass within the Town’s Boundaries.Floods on the Susquehanna River and Fishing Creek can be caused by heavy rain, snowmelt, or ice jams. On Fishing Creek they can come with little or no warning. Floods can stay up for several days, isolating areas and causing increased damage to property. Check the Bloomsburg Flood Gauge.

Risk Factor






















Know Your Risks 



















 














Anywhere it can rain, it can flood 



We all live with the risk of flood damage to our property. Learn more details about your home’s level of flood risk, including the type of flood zone it is in, and if available the potential flood elevation (referred to as the “base flood elevation” on a flood map). 













Learn if your property is in the floodplain or floodway

20.0 ftHigh water affects the fairgrounds & surrounding area 



22.0 ftA number of homes located between fairgrounds and the river are affected

36.5 ftFEMA 0.2% annual chance of flood(500-year flood) 



39.5 ftFlood waters begin to reach the Rupert Bridge in Catawissa 





















Know what past floods have done. The Town of Bloomsburg has experienced four floods that were higher than the base flood (28ft). Tropical Storm Lee in September 2011 the flood level reached 32.75 feet. In 1904, flood levels reached 32.7 feet. Flooding caused by Hurricane Agnes in 1972 reached 31 feet and in 2006 flood levels reached 28.8 feet.Flooding occurs in Bloomsburg when water levels at the Bloomsburg gauge reach 19 feet. The Town recorded measurable flooding in 1975 (27.5 ft); 2004 (27.1 ft) and seven floods greater than 23 feet occurred in 1979, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1993, 1996, and 2005. In March 2011, a flood level of 22.57 was reached.See if your property is in the mapped floodplain and subject to overbank flooding by calling the Code Enforcement and Zoning Office at 570-784-7703. Find out what past floods have done. Elevation Certificates for some properties are on file and available at Town Hall in the Code Enforcement Office. 






















What can you do? 







First, find out what flooding can do to you. See if your property is in the mapped floodplain and subject to overbank flooding by calling the Code Enforcement and Zoning Officer at 784-7703. Find out how deep it could be and what past floods have done. 











Second, protect yourself and your family during a flood. Read the later section on flood safety. 











Third, several of the Town’s efforts depend on your cooperation and assistance. Here is how you can help:Do not dump or throw anything into the channels or drainage ways. Even grass clippings and branches can accumulate and plug channels. A plugged channel cannot carry water and when it rains the water has to go somewhere. Every piece of trash contributes to flooding.You can do your part in helping the drainage system work. Sweep or pick up your gutters to prevent blockages in the storm sewers. Pick up trash and fallen branches in the ditches.If you see dumping or debris in the channels or drainage ways, contact the Public Works Department at 570-784-2300.Always check with the Code Enforcement and Zoning Officer before you build on, alter, regrade, or fill on your property. A permit may be needed to ensure that projects do not cause problems on other properties.If you see a building or filling without a permit sign posted, contact the Code Enforcement and Zoning Office at 570-784-7703. 











Fourth, check out how you can protect your property. Read the later sections on floodproofing and insurance. If you have any questions or want more information on flood protection, talk to the Code Enforcement and Zoning Office at 570-784-7703.

How to file a flood insurance claim


























Flood Protection Measures 























Phase 1 Flood Wall – Oct.11, 2016 The Columbia County flood wall surrounding the Autoneum plant and the former Windsor Foods Factory was officially dedicated. 







Phase 2 Flood Wall – Oct 7, 2020 The second phase of the flood wall protecting the Bloomsburg High & Middle School Complex along with approximately 100 homes was dedicated. 






















The town of Bloomsburg also... 
















– Participates in the National Flood Insurance Program Community Rating System – provides a flood insurance premium discount available to anyone: The property owner or renter may purchase NFIP insurance– Regulates Construction in the floodplain to assure compliance with flood ordinances. Click to view the floodplain permit– The Public Works department inspects and cleans the streets, channels, and drainage ways. Keeping them clear reduces the chances that blockages will cause flooding on adjacent properties. 







– Purchased eleven Repetitive loss properties in the 900 block of West Main Street.– Completed two home elevation projects through grant funding. Two additional homes pending– Active participant in the Columbia County Hazard Mitigation Plan adopted on April 6th, 2023.– Participated in a Regional stormwater study completed in November 2020.– Participating in Columbia County Fishing Creek Study 














Flood Smart














NFIP






























Floods are the nation’s most common and costly natural disaster, causing billions of dollars in damage each year. Homeowners and renters insurance does not typically cover flood damage. 



Bloomsburg is a Class 7CRS Community. All NFIP policies receive a 15% discount 







Flood Insurance 











Any house in Bloomsburg can be covered by a flood insurance policy. Detached garages and accessory buildings are covered under the policy for the main building. There are two types of coverage which can be purchased separately.STRUCTURAL Covers everything that stays with a house when it is sold, including the furnace, cabinets, built in appliances and wall to wall carpeting.CONTENTS Covers furniture and other personal possessions except for money, valuable papers and the like. There is no coverage for things outside the house like the driveway and landscaping. If you have a policy check it closely. You may only have structural coverage (because that’s all that banks require).Don’t wait for the next flood to buy flood insurance. There is a 30 day waiting period before NFIP coverage takes effect. 






















Bloomsburg Flood Ordinance 











Reduce Your Risk. Decide how to prepare your family and protect your home from flooding. Based on your home’s flood risk, create a plan to mitigate the risk to your property. Even after a mitigation project, some risk will remain, so learn about more actions to prepare and protect your family, home, and belongings at www.ready.gov/make-a-plan 






FLOOD ORDINANCE






















Flood proofing 











Floodproofing a house means altering it so floodwaters will not cause damage. Different floodproofing techniques are appropriate for different types of buildings. Use the following as a guideline: 










BASEMENT














SLAB FOUNDATION














CRAWLSPACE











An excellent source for more information is Homeowner’s Guide to Retrofitting: (FEMA Publication 312). It can be read at the Bloomsburg Public Library (225 Market Street), ordered (for free) from the Federal Emergency Management Agency by calling 800-480-2520.No matter what kind of building you have, some last-minute emergency measures can always help. For example, you could move valuable items (photos, antiques, and other “irreplaceables” etc.) or items that are most damaged by floodwaters (upholstered furniture, stuffed toys, mattresses, etc.) up to a higher level. You can place sandbags or plastic sheeting in front of doorways and other low entry points. Whatever emergency protec­tion measures you use, it is always best to have a plan written in advance to make sure you don’t forget anything after you hear the flood warning. Keep in mind the flood safety hints in the preceding section. The Red Cross has some additional suggestions. The substantial damage requirements are explained in more detail in Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings. 



















Substantial Damage 











The ordinance requires that all substantial improvements to a building will require the entire building to be treated as a new building. A substantial improvement is when the value of an addition, alteration, repair, or reconstruction project exceeds 50% of the value of the existing building. In the case of an addition, only the addition must be protected. In the case of an improvement to the original building, the entire building must be protected from future substantial damages.

When Returning Home 



Do not enter your home if a notice has been posted by the Town of Bloomsburg’s Code Enforcement office. If you have any questions or immediate concerns regarding reentry to your property please contact the Code Office first via 570-784-7703Check the exterior first for damage before enteringDo not strike a match or smoke in case of a gas leakOpen windows and doors to circulate the airTake photos and call an insurance agentAs a reminder before doing any renovation work, please contact the Code Enforcement Office at 570-784-7703 to obtain a building permit 













Basement Floodproofing 



If you have a basement, split level, or other floors below ground level, there are lots of ways to protect your basement or lower floor from seepage and sewer backup. 













Slab Foundation Floodproofing 



If your house is on a slab foundation, investigate a low floodwall berm or “dry floodproofing” i.e. making the walls watertight and closing all the openings when a flood comes. 













Crawlspace Floodproofing 



If your house is on a crawl space or basement foundation, a low floodwall berm or “wet floodproofing” will work. This is moving all items subject to damage out of harm’s way so water can flow into the crawlspace or basement and not cause any problems. For a more effective measure, it is relatively easy to elevate the building to get the first floor above the flood level.
