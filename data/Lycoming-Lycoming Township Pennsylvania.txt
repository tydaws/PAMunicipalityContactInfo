Covid 19 Notice to Prospective Jurors
You have been summoned for jury service during a most extraordinary time. Jury duty is important because it safeguards one of the most crucial rights of the American legal system. As trials continue to take place, the court must continue to rely on civic-minded jurors like you for help in ensuring fairness and providing impartial viewpoints in cases. Operating a judicial system during a worldwide pandemic requires sacrifice, collaboration, and creativity. Jury trials are among the most important work of the court. The constitutional right to a jury trial does not end with a pandemic, and trials cannot happen without jurors. Your potential role as a juror could not be more critical; however, we understand that your ability to serve may be impacted by the pandemic. Please refer to the green sheet contained in this mailing for excusal and deferral information. If you have not been deferred or excused, please appear as directed in your summons.
Please know that we will continue to closely monitor our local situation as to whether to proceed with jury selections and trials, and we will make every effort to comply with CDC guidelines as well as state and local recommendations to ensure your safety and security. For instance, following is a list of some of the safety precautions we have implemented in the past necessitated by the circumstances in existence at the time of your service.    

Face masks and/or face shields;
Staggered juror reporting times;
Use of multiple rooms for juror assembly to allow for increased physical distancing;
Limited numbers of jurors and other persons in the courthouse and courtrooms;
Use of only larger courtrooms for jury selections to allow for increased physical distancing;
Routine disinfecting of areas accessed by jurors; and
Widely available hand sanitizer.  

Please bring your own snack and a drink in a plastic container with you to jury selection. You are also welcome to bring along a book or magazine to occupy your time during any periods of inactivity.
We take the health and safety of our jurors very seriously. If you are experiencing symptoms such as a fever, cough, or shortness of breath or if you have been exposed to someone who is experiencing similar symptoms, do NOT report for service. Instead, please contact the Office of the District Court Administrator for further instruction.
After you have carefully reviewed all of the enclosed information, if you have any questions or concerns, please contact the Office of the District Court Administrator at 570-327-2243 or juryinfo@lyco.org.  Thank you in advance for your time, service, and cooperation.
With appreciation,
Nancy L. Butts, President Judge
