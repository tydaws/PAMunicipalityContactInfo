Federal regulations require the removal of refrigerants from refrigerators, freezers, air conditioners, and dehumidifiers prior to disposal. All items containing refrigerants will be collected by appointment only, separate from regular trash collection. Also large bulk items such as a piano or household furnace will require a special collection.  Special Collections will require scheduling a pickup by contacting  J.P.

Commercial Recycling
Who Must Recycle?
Commercial, industrial and institutional establishments, such as retail stores, restaurants, offices, schools, nursing and assisted living facilities, rehabilitation centers, warehouses, hospitals and churches are required to create and operate recycling programs.
What Must be Recycled?
The law requires the following items be recycled by Commercial, Industrial, and Institutional Entities:

Corrugated paper
Newsprint
Aluminum
Leaf waste including leaves, shrubbery, branches and similar vegetative materials.

Materials should be stored separately until picked up. Businesses are required to handle and arrange their own waste and recycling collection.
Why Recycle?
State law mandates businesses to recycle. This law has been in effect since 1988. There are also economic and environmental reasons. Why send something to a landfill if it can be reused? Recycling saves money and resources, and reduces disposal costs. Reducing trash lowers disposal costs. There are companies that purchase recyclable material.
How TO Start A Recycling PROGRAM:
A Successful Program Needs:

Top level management support...the success of your recycling program hinges upon the endorsement of senior management. Their positive support promotes a similar attitude among the establishment's employees and customers. Also, recycling programs often require initial outlays of capital.
A coordinator...a person in charge of developing, managing, and enforcing the program, who is responsible for its success and who others may contact with questions.
A task force...To assist the coordinator in developing the initial program. Custodial staff, administrative staff, and educators should be included.
A waste audit...To determine who's throwing away what and how much is being trashed. Reduction and reuse should also be considered.
A market investigation....To determine where your recyclable materials can be processed. Most waste haulers offer collection of recyclables. Some companies buy recyclable material.
A convenient collection system...With attractive, easy to use containers, near the action...next to the computer and soda machine...or a central storage area. Personnel are needed to collect and record information on how much of what is being recycled.
A review of procurement policies ....To determine if other products can be substituted for current supplies that are recyclable and/or made of recycled materials. Perhaps current buying practices can be revised.
An education program....To inform staff about the program, program goals, the value of waste reduction and recycling, and periodically encourage people to continue recycling. Remind them they're doing the right thing to help themselves, their community and the environment.

Frequently Asked Questions
What is the "Earned Income Tax?"The Earned Income Tax, commonly called a "Wage Tax," is usually a tax of one percent (1%) on gross wages and/or net profits from a business or profession. Typically, individuals who receive "earned income," including salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses, incentive payments, fees, tips and/or other compensation for services rendered, whether in cash or property, are subject to the tax. In addition, those who conduct businesses, professions and other activities for profit must pay tax on the net profit derived from their operation after deductions have been made of all costs and expenses incurred in conducting said business.
What income is specifically exempt from the earned income tax?Unearned income such as dividends, interest, income from trusts, bonds, insurance and stocks is exempt. Also exempt are payments for third party sick or disability benefits, old age benefits, retirement pay, pensions - including social security payments, public assistance or unemployment compensation payments made by any governmental agency, and any wages or compensation paid by the United States for active service in the forces of the United States including bonuses or additional compensation for such service. In addition, net profits of corporations are exempt under state law.
If the tax is withheld in another community where I work, do I also pay the district in which I live?No, the tax withheld by your employer will be remitted to your resident taxing jurisdiction. It is still required that our Registration Form be answered by all residents.
Whose earned income tax will be withheld by their employer?Any individual working in a jurisdiction that levies the tax on residents and non-residents will have the tax withheld by their employer. If you work in a jurisdiction that does NOT tax non-residents, your employer is only required to withhold for those individuals who live in that jurisdiction. Occasionally, employers located in a jurisdiction where the tax is not levied will volunteer to withhold if your resident jurisdiction levies the tax.
From whom will the earned income tax be collected directly?The earned income tax will be collected directly from those who are: (1) self-employed; (2) salaried but self-employed in a side business; or (3) work in a municipality where the tax is not in place. Those persons must file a declaration of the total of such estimated net profits or income, together with the total estimated tax due, with the Earned Income Tax Collector. Proper forms for reporting the quarterly payments will be sent to each person so liable.
Must all taxpayers file a return?Yes. Even if all tax is withheld, or quarterly payments are made, a Local Earned Income Tax Return must be filed by April 15 each year.
What happens if I neither file a return nor pay the tax due?State law, as well as the local tax resolutions and/or ordinances, make it a summary criminal offense if a taxpayer fails to file a tax return as required, and subjects the taxpayer to a fine not to exceed $500.00 per offense, plus the cost of prosecution; in default of payment of said fine and costs, the taxpayer may be imprisoned for a period not exceeding thirty (30) days per offense. In addition, distress sale, wage attachment and/or civil suit proceedings may be used to collect any unpaid tax found to be due, and penalties and interest may also be assessed.

Upper Southampton Township
Southampton, PA is a namesake of Southampton, England, the seaport from which adventurous followers of William Penn sailed to the Province of Pennsylvania. Upper Southampton Township has embraced industry and development, but retains a certain small-town feeling. It is a "nice place to live."
