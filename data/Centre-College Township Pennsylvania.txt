As part of the consideration of an “operational license,” the PGCB will host a minimum of two (2) public hearings on any proposed casino location. On August 16, 2021, the PGCB hosted the first of these public hearings on the proposed Category 4 Mini-Casino application at the Penn Stater Conference Center located in College Township. The PGCB accepted public comment on the proposed project from that date through 5:00 pm on Sunday, June 12, 2022. The second public hearing on this project will be held in Harrisburg where SC Gaming Op Co., LLC representatives and the PGCB’s Office of Enforcement Counsel will offer any updated evidence and make oral argument as to whether the license should be granted. The date for this second public hearing has yet to be announced.Initial PGCB Public Hearing - August 16, 2021  - August 16, 2021 PGCB Public Hearing Recording (YouTube)   - Public Hearing Presentation (PDF)    - Public Hearing  Speakers List (PDF)  - Transcript - State College Gaming OPCO - Public Hearing (PDF)  - Public Comments Received By Hearing Deadline (PDF)  - Late Public Comments Received After Hearing Deadline (PDF)  - Additional Public Input Received After Hearing Deadline (PDF)  - Late Public Comments received 9/14 through 9/29 (PDF)  - Late Public Comments received 9/30 through 10/13 (PDF)  - Late Public Comments received 10/12 through 10/27 (PDF)  - Late Public Comments received 10/28 through 12/9 (PDF)   - Late Public Comments received 12/15/21 through 1/11/22 (PDF)  - Late Public Comments received 1/11/22 through 1/27/22 (PDF)  - Late Public Comments received 1/27/22 through 2/11/22 (PDF)  - Late Public Comments received 2/13/22 through 3/10/22 (PDF)  - Late Public Comments received 4/1/22 through 4/15/22 (PDF)  - Late Public Comments received 4/15/22 through 5/23/22 (PDF)  - Late Public Comments received 5/22/22 through 5/31/22 (PDF)  - Late Public Comments received 6/1/22 through 6/8/22 (PDF)  - Late Public Comments received from 6/10/22 through 6/12/22 at 5 PM (PDF)  - Publicly Displayed Comments from Online Petition Opposing Nittany Mall Casino 6/11/22 (PDF)  - Summary Additional Signatures for Hard Copy Petition Opposing Nittany Mall Casino 6/12/22 (PDF)  - Summary Additional Signatures for Online Petition Opposing Nittany Mall Casino 6/12/22 (PDF)    - Summary Hard Copy Petition Opposing Nittany Mall Casino 6/11/22 (PDF)  - Summary Online Petition Opposing Nittany Mall Casino 6/11/22 (PDF)  - Summary Petition Opposing Nittany Mall Casino Duplicate Detection Worksheet 6/11/22 (PDF)  - Additional Publicly Displayed Comments from Online Petition Opposing Nittany Mall Casino 6/11/2022  - SC_Gaming_comments_from_Website_May_22_June_12_2022 (PDF)Petition for Intervention Hearing - December 14, 2022- December 14, 2022 PGCB Petition for Intervention Hearing Recording (YouTube)- PGCB Order Regarding Petition to Intervene 12-14-22 (PDF) PGCB Second Public Hearing - January 25, 2023- January 25, 2023 PGCB Second Public Hearing Recording (YouTube) - PGCB Order Regarding SC Gaming Category 4 Casino License Application
