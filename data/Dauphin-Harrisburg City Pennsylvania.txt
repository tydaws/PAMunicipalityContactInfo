Bureau of Information Technology









About Us

The Bureau of Information Technology is responsible for the administration of the City’s blend of mainframe, network and cloud-based computer systems. These systems are utilized by General Government and the Departments of Administration, Public Safety and Public Works.
The bureau programs, controls, troubleshoots and monitors a wide array of mainframe-based systems used throughout the City’s operations. Examples of these systems include the computerized billing system for property real estate taxes, mercantile taxes and licenses; billings for disposal and refuse charges; human resource management; Treasury accounts receivable system, insurance claims management; field reports for all service calls for police; and Codes licenses, permits, inspections and complaints.
The bureau also provides technical support and maintenance for the City’s network of personal computers, laptops and mobile devices; and is responsible for the installation, maintenance, and troubleshooting of servers, routers, switches, and firewalls for the City’s Local Area Network (LAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN). Responsibilities extend to troubleshooting of computer software, hardware, peripherals, telecommunications systems and services, and related equipment.
The bureau partners with various local, state and national organizations to extend and expand the technological capabilities of the City’s operations. Evaluating emerging technologies and vendor offerings assists with the process of modernizing and streamlining processes and systems deployed throughout the City.
Daily responsibilities include: monitoring, configuring, and troubleshooting server backups and restoring systems; monitoring virus activity and cyber threats through a central management console; implementing LAN and local printer services; moving, adding, deleting and upgrading software.

Frequently Asked Questions

How should I prepare for the physical fitness test?
The Physical Fitness Test is a specific battery of tests that applicants must be able to pass. The standard used in the physical fitness test were derived from law enforcement physical fitness norms that are based on a representative sample of approximately 4000 officers that were stratified (by age and gender) and randomly selected from 40 municipal, state and federal agencies. The physical fitness test measures those job-related physical fitness areas that have been shown to be underlying and predictive factors for officer physical abilities to perform the essential physical tasks and functions of the job. This is a Pass/Fail test.

How should I prepare for the written test?
The written test is designed to measure basic skills, reading, writing and arithmetic that are important for successfully learning and performing an entry-level, law enforcement position. An online Study Guide will be available for purchase at https://www.applytoserve.com/Study/.
In addition to the study guide, an online practice test is available by visiting https://www.applytoserve.com/Study/. The Online POST Practice Test enables you to prepare yourself by taking an online practice version of the test you will encounter on exam day. Each section of the practice test is timed the same as the real test and feedback is received once the test has been completed or after time expires. Thorough explanations are provided for each incorrect response so you better understand how to improve.

KEEP OUR CITY CLEAN






Trash & Recycling Collection

All of the residential trash and recycling in Harrisburg is collected by employees of the City’s Department of Public Works. Every resident is serviced once a week; the city is divided into five zones, one for each day of the week. We invite you to visit Recycle Coach where you can find your collection schedule by entering your address.
Every customer is to use the standard trash and recycling containers provided by the City. All containers are to be placed at the appointed collection location the evening before the assigned day of collection. If you have questions about waste containers or where they should be placed on collection day, or about your account, please call 717-412-4320.
Each household is entitled to dispose of one bulk item each week, such as a piece of furniture, a mattress, a bedspring, a role of carpeting, etc… Large appliances are not included in bulk items and are subject to a removal fee. Please direct questions regarding the disposal of large appliances to the Department of Public Works. Please do not pile bulk items in front of your property. Only one will be collected each week; all others are subject to a fine.
Note: City-wide holidays will delay collection by one day for the rest of the week (Friday’s collection moves to Saturday, for example).

More About Recycling

Recycling is the easiest way to keep trash disposal costs to a minimum, which is why every resident can have extra recycling bins at no extra charge. In addition to the curb-side single-stream collection for every household, it is important for each resident to recycle several products that cannot be included with the single-stream:
Cardboard:  If you have more cardboard boxes than can fit easily into your recycling barrel, please break the boxes down and bundle them together with a piece of string. If it is raining on your collection day, please consider storing the cardboard until the next collection time. Please put pizza boxes in the trash.
Glass Bottles & Jars:  Bottles & Jars should be separated from other recyclables and dropped off at any of the 10 drop-off sites around the city. This glass is taken, at no charge to the City, by a recycler who gives it a new life.
Plastic shopping bags:  All Harrisburg-area grocery stores and many of the big-box stores have bins at their front doors to accept your plastic shopping bags and other plastic wrap such as dry-cleaning bags and the wrappers for paper towels and bath tissues. Please save your plastic bags and take them to the store for recycling. They are used to manufacture plastic lumber products.
Small Electric Appliances, including toasters, microwave ovens, TVs, and computers: Harrisburg residents are able to take old electronic devices in any condition to the Dauphin County Recycling Center.  It is free of charge for Dauphin County residents and very important to properly dispose these items.

Yard Waste (Leaves, Woody Waste from Trees, Shrubs)

Yard waste does not include grass; please cut grass often enough to avoid raking so clipping are natural mulch for the lawn.
Do not place yard waste with your trash.
A yard waste collection truck will pick up these items on street cleaning days:

Please bundle tree & shrub trimmings into paper compost bags separate from leaves
Please bundle leaves into paper compost bags separate from trimmings
Tie branches no more than 4 feet long in bundles.

For more information, call 717-412-4320 





Construction and Demolition Waste

Construction and demolition waste does not go in the trash. Plaster board, sheet rock, lumber, rocks, soil, cinder blocks and plumbing fixtures should be taken to the transfer station at the Incinerator on 19th Street.
If you need to dispose of construction waste, are cleaning out a house, or have a large amount of yard waste, please consider renting a roll-off container or dumpster from Public Works for that purpose. Alternately you can hire a professional hauler.
