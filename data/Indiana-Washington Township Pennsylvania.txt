Septic Haulers as of March 2022.
Septic Tank Pumping Requirements for Property Owners 
In Washington Township
In accordance with the PA Department of Environmental Protection regulations, Washington Township residents must have their septic tanks pumped every three years by an APPROVED sewage hauler.
To comply with this regulation in the most efficient manner, Washington Township is divided into three separate districts – Eastern, Central and Western.  Each district has the three-year requirement, but only one district will be pumped each year.
Current Pumping Rotation:
  The Western portion of the Township must be pumped in 2025 and every third year thereafter.
      The Central portion of the Township must be pumped in 2023 and every third year thereafter.
       The Eastern portion of the Township must be pumped in 2024 and every third year thereafter.
Each pumping is good for THREE years with the districts rotating in turn each year.
Districts and Locations:
District #1 – Western Portion – Zullinger and Marsh Road area.
District #2 – Central Portion – located along PA Rt. 316 on the west to Old Forge/Midvale Road on the east, including Calimer Drive.
District #3 – Eastern Portion – from Old Forge Road/ Midvale Road east to the Adams County line including the Blue Ridge Summit and Pen Mar areas.
The Township Supervisors administrative offices mails a notice and reminders each year to the appropriate district property owners, along with a listing of approved haulers – haulers you must use to pump your septic tank.  These approved haulers have been registered with PA DEP and have met all requirements as outlined in Chapter 271-35 of the Code of the Township of Washington.
Once the tank has been pumped, the property owner OR the hauler must notify the Township administrative office of the date the tank was pumped and the name of the hauler that pumped the tank.
If you have any questions, contact the Township Administrative Office at 717-762-3128.

Appalachian Trail Information


The Appalachian National Scenic Trail is the world famous hiking trail that traverses approximately 2,200 miles from Springer Mountain in Georgia to Mount Katahdin in Maine, passing through 14 states on its route. 
The Trail passes through the eastern portion of Washington Township, crossing six roadways. The road crossings serve as points of access to the Trail in Washington Township. The Trail can also be accessed locally in nearby Pen Mar Park in Washington County, Maryland and several locations in Quincy Township.
The Washington Township portion of the trail is located within a two day hike – approximately 30 miles – of the Trail’s midway point and the Appalachian Trail Museum in Pine Grove Furnace State Park.

Washington Township Municipal Complex Information

11798 Buchanan Trail East Waynesboro, PA. 17268


In early July of 2020 Mrs. Alma W. Oyer contacted the Police Chief and asked if we were interested in receiving a 3.27-acre tract of land located in Rouzerville at 11898 Buchanan Trail East.  This is the residue of a property that Mrs. Oyer and her late husband, Nickson W. Oyer had owned for many years. The Oyer family had constructed their Construction Company’s office, W. R. Oyer, Inc. on part of the property and constructed some commercial rental buildings on the remainder.  On July 29th of 2020 Mrs. Oyer graciously donated the property to the Washington Township Supervisors to construct an Office Facility. 
A new facility has been in the focus of the Supervisors for many years and in 2004, the Board of Supervisors decided to construct a temporary office facility at their property at 13013 Welty Road. 
The Supervisors have contracted with Newcomer Associates in Chambersburg, PA to provide conceptual drawings for the facility.  Preliminary drawings are available below.
At this time the preliminary plans call for a 12,000 square foot office building that will house the Police Department and Administrative Offices including a public meeting room, the Planning & Zoning Department, the Code Enforcement Officer, Building Inspector and the Tax Office.
Start of construction is undetermined at this time but the hope would be to start in the spring of 2022.
 The property is large enough to house the Public Works Road Department and is considered for construction later.

Governor Wolf’s Administration Encourages Pennsylvanians “Resolve to be Ready”
Wolf Administration Encourages Pennsylvanians to “Resolve to be Ready”by Planning for Emergencies in the New Year
As the decade draws to a close and millions of Pennsylvanians’ thoughts turn toward the positive changes they want to see in their lives, Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency (PEMA) Director Randy Padfield is encouraging citizens to “Resolve to be Ready” by creating family emergency plans and emergency kits.
“The single, most effective way to ensure the safety of your loved ones during an emergency situation is to have a plan,” Padfield said. “Being prepared and knowing ahead of time how to react are critical elements of emergency response training. You can do the same by practicing your plan and having a basic emergency kit.”
Padfield said to create an emergency plan, you should:

Identify locations in both your community and in a nearby town, where you can meet loved ones;
Identify an out-of-town contact everyone can check in with;
Text or use social media to let others know you are safe and where you are;
Have hard copies of lists of phone numbers and other important information such as doctor’s offices as well as copies of important documents; and
Practice your plan just like you would a fire drill.

A basic emergency kit should include enough basic supplies to support your loved ones for several days. Padfield said it should include:

One gallon of water per person per day;
Non-perishable food and a manual can opener;
Vital medical supplies, hearing aid batteries or other medical equipment and mobility devices you may need;
Specialized items such as baby supplies and pet care products;
First aid kit;
Hand-crank or battery operated flashlights and radio;
Car cell phone chargers or battery packs;
Special toys or supplies to keep children and pets occupied and busy.

Additional resources, including emergency plan templates and emergency kit checklists, are available on the ReadyPA website. Padfield also encourages social media users to follow PEMA on Facebook and Twitter for timely emergency preparedness information. It’s important to note that you do not need to have a Facebook or Twitter account to access the information.
