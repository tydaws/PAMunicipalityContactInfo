Why Move to Gilpin Township?
Nestled along the Allegheny and Kiskiminetas Rivers and conveniently located only 15 minutes to PA-Route 28 and 45 minutes to the City of Pittsburgh, historic Gilpin Township holds opportunities for all!Consisting of 17.14 sq. miles and lying within the Leechburg Area School District, much of Gilpin Township is a rural atmosphere offering a quiet and peaceful country setting for all. Though rural, Gilpin Township leaves plenty of room to grow without effecting its rural charm. Through it's Zoning and administration, Gilpin Township offers opportunity for business, industrial, and residential growth. Made up of over half of the Township's PA-Route 66 corridor, our Business District provides the daily traffic of Route 66 and plenty of buildable land while also providing both Public Water and Sewer Access. A five year daily average shows approximately 4,180 travelers a day along this corridor. Along the Allegheny and Kiski Rivers, the Schenley Industrial Park and shuttered ATI Bagdad Plant offer access by both water and road to best serve any form of Industrial Development. A large majority of the Township is made up of Residential and Agricultural Zoning. In these districts, regulations allow for easy development for both farmland and residential growth, with much of the Agricultural and Residental Districts being serviced with both Public Sewer and Water Access. Our Zoning protects our rural charm, while making living and building here as easy as possible!Lastly, Gilpin Township will soon offer two forms of Recreational Districts along various portion of our waterways. These areas are occupied by many campsites and part-time residents of the Township and give ample opportunities of recreational enjoyment!To help you plant your roots here, Gilpin Township offers up to 10 year property tax abatements on new constructon via our LERTA program. You can learn more about LERTA here!
Interested in building or developing in our Township? Feel free to reach out at 724-845-0981 or email cstull@gilpintwp.com!



Gilpin Township welcomes the opportunity to engage in discussions on matters involving public township business. However, the Second Class Township Codes require an affirmative vote of a majority of the Board of Supervisors at a public meeting in order to transact any business. Accordingly, while Supervisors and staff may engage in discussions with those seeking comment, guidance, advice or direction, no such discussions shall constitute action by the Township unless there is an affirmative vote of the majority of the Board of Supervisors at a duly advertised public meeting.
