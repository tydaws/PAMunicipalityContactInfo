Eagleview/Pictometry Online
Greene County has contracted with Pictometry International Corporation © since 2006 to provide aerial imagery of the county. Datasets every 2 years, starting with 2006, are available.

Our license agreement allows us to sell the imagery as well but prohibits us from giving access to private individuals, the State/Federal Government, or for-profit entities.
