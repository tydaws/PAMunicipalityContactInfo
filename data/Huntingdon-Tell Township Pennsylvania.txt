CHAPTER LV.
 
TELL TOWNSHIP.
 
Geographical and Natural Features. - This is one of the southeast 
      border townships of Huntingdon County, and was erected from Dublin 
      township in April, 1810, and bounded as follows: On the northeast by 
      Juniata County, on the southeast by Franklin County, on the southwest by 
      Dublin township, and on the northwest by Cromwell and Shirley townships. 
      The surface of the township is very uneven, the summit of Tuscarora 
      Mountain forming the southeast line between the township and Franklin 
      County. Nearly or quite four hundred rods northwest from Tuscarora 
      Mountain is Hunting Ridge, a limestone formation running parallel with 
      Tuscarora and the entire length of that side of the township. About four 
      hundred and fifty rods northwest from and nearly parallel with Hunting is 
      Big Ridge, a series of limestone elevations running across the township, 
      and still farther northwest and parallel with Big is Pine Ridge, which 
      might better be termed mountain. This, too, extends the entire length of 
      the township, and last, but not least, is Shade Mountain, along the crest 
      of which is the dividing line between Tell, Cromwell, and Shirley 
      townships. These mountains and ridges all run in the same direction, from 
      southwest to northeast, and between these mountains and ridges are several 
      hills or knobs of no very small dimensions, and reach also to a 
      respectable altitude. Between the mountains, ridges, and hills are long, 
      narrow valleys, in which are several very good farms, where large crops of 
      wheat, corn, oats, and potatoes are raised. There are four roads or 
      highways running through as many valleys the entire length of the 
      township, besides several roads passing through the mountain gorges from 
      one valley to the other.
 
The principal creek of the township is the Tuscarora. This rises in 
      Dublin township and flows northeasterly along the northwest foot of 
      Hunting Ridge, through the hamlet of Nossville, to the Kern farm, where it 
      breaks through Hunting Ridge in an easterly direction, then flows 
      northeast into Juniata County.
 
Trough Spring Creek rises on the McNeal and Berrier farms in the 
      southerly part of the township, flows northeasterly along the narrow 
      valley between Pine Ridge and Shade Mountain to Silverthorne's mill at 
      Shade Valley post-office, where it turns easterly, breaks through Pine 
      Ridge, and empties into Tuscarora Creek on the Kern' farm, at the foot of 
      Hunting Ridge.
 
Block's Run rises on the Shoop farm, in the southwest part of the 
      township, flows northeasterly along the valley between Pine and Big Ridge, 
      emptying into Trough Spring Creek a mile east of Shade Valley post-office.
      
Georges Creek rises in the north corner of the township, and flows 
      southeast to Coulter's old mill-seat, thence easterly into Juniata County.
 
Narrows Creek rises in Franklin County, flowing northwesterly, past 
      Orr's mill-seat, into the Tuscarora below Blair's Mills. 
Three Lick Creek rises in the southwest end of the township, and flows 
      southwest into Dublin township. There are some twenty-five or thirty 
      tributaries of the above-named creeks, but without names.
 
Pioneer Settlers. - In the "Land Lien Docket" for Huntingdon County may 
      be found a right granted Feb. 3, 1755, to Barnabas Barnes, for a tract of 
      land in Tell, or what is now Tell township. Just where this tract was 
      located, or whether Mr. Barnes settled on it, we have been unable to 
      ascertain; however, many tracts of land are located by parties who never 
      see the land or know anything of its value only through their agents.
 
Among the pioneer settlers of what is now Tell township we find the 
      following who located here previous to 1800: Samuel McMath came to this 
      township in the year 1780, and located in the valley near the mouth of 
      Trough Spring Branch Creek, where several of his descendants still reside. 
      John McMath, son of Samuel, located at the Ridge. Robert Vaughan located 
      some time in 1780 or 1781, on the farm now owned by his son, Robert 
      Vaughan, who is now an old man. He located northwest from what is now 
      Blair's Mills. James Stonkard located near Blair's Mills previous to 1790. 
      The farm is now owned by Mrs. James Orr. Thomas Morrow located here in 
      1784. He came with his father, Richard Morrow, who was grandfather of J. 
      B. Morrow, son of Thomas, and took up one hundred acres of land, now the 
      property of J. A. Blair. J. B. Morrow is now a resident of the hamlet of 
      Blair's Mills. Robert Stonkard was one of the pioneers of this part of 
      Tell. The property is now owned by G. H. & R. A. Speer. William McMullen 
      located in the north part of Tell in 1786. The tract that he located is 
      now owned by J. M. Blair, J. M. Morrison, and --- Robinson. Isaac Gifford 
      located west of Blair's Mills in 1780. There were also William Gifford and 
      Joseph Gifford. The Gifford tract is still in the Gifford family. Jonathan 
      S. Briggs, John Gilliland, and John Jeffries located in this township in 
      1790. Among the other early settlers in this neighborhood were Jacob 
      Stong, Adam Stong, Sr., Adam Stong, Jr., Daniel Stong, James Pattison, 
      William Down, Samuel Briggs, John Briggs, and Michael Kern, all of whom 
      were here previous to 1791.
 
The pioneer locator and settler in the Shade Valley, or rather along 
      Trough Spring Creek, southwest of Shade Valley post-office, was Jacob 
      Goshorn, who came here in 1780. This name has been written differently at 
      different periods, first Ganshorn, then Gooshorn, as will be found in 
      early town records, and now Goshorn. He located a large tract along this 
      valley, for nearly or quite three and a half miles by one mile wide. The 
      tract ran nearly a mile northeast of Shade Valley post-office, or 
      Silverthorn's Mills. The original tract is owned in part as follows: 
      Samuel Book, three hundred and sixty-eight acres; William P. Goshorn, one 
      hundred and fifty acres; Martin Fleming, eighty acres; Samuel Waters, one 
      hundred and twenty acres; and Robert Goshorn owns a large plantation out 
      of the original tract. Samuel Book located here in 1849. The Quinns and 
      Wagners were also early settlers in this locality.
 
Along farther towards the southwest end of the township we find the 
      families of Felmlee, Shorp, Wilson, Cisney, Waters, Parsons, Chilcote, 
      Bollinger, and others, who located here from 1795 to 1820.
 
Religions. - From the number of meeting-houses in Tell township used 
      for religious purposes it would naturally be inferred that the spiritual 
      welfare of the inhabitants had not been forgotten, however much it might 
      have been neglected in after-years. For want of proper records we are 
      unable to give date of organization of the societies or churches, names of 
      pioneer members, or date of building the meeting-houses, except in one or 
      two instances, and must content ourselves with giving merely the location 
      of each. One of the United Brethren's Churches is located opposite the 
      school-house, in the Parsons settlement, south part of the township. 
      Adjoining the church is the burying-ground. Methodist Episcopal Church, 
      located in the hamlet of Nossville, built in 1872. The old Union Church, 
      north of Nossville, built in 1830, has not been occupied for a long time, 
      and is fast going to decay. Mount Zion United Brethren Church, northwest 
      of Blair's Mills, was built in 1852. W. B. McMullen, James Rhea, and 
      Edward Roles are among its prominent members. There is also a small 
      Methodist Episcopal Church situate in the extreme north point of the 
      township, the membership of which is nearly or quite all residents of 
      Juniata County. Richvale Methodist Episcopal Church, located on 
      Silverthorn's Mill, or Shade Valley post-office, is a neat frame building, 
      erected in 1874. D. P. Osborn is the superintendent of the Sunday-school 
      connected with this church, and Revs. Dunning and Hamm are the preachers 
      on this circuit.
 
Villages and Hamlets. - NOSSVILLE is a flourishing little hamlet, 
      located about midway between the southwest and northeast end of the 
      township, on the banks of the Tuscarora Creek. There is at this place 
      quite an extensive tannery, built in 1848 or 1849, and now owned and 
      operated by Oswill B. Mosser, who also owns a store in connection with his 
      tannery. There is also a store at this place by William B. Kling. The 
      grist- and saw-mills of Thomas Cisney, located half a mile above the town, 
      were built in 1836 or 1837. There is also at Nossville a blacksmith-, 
      shoe-shop, post-office, and Methodist Episcopal Church.
 


 
OSWILL B. MOSSER
 
DAVID MOSSER, the father of the subject of this sketch, was born in 
      Lehigh County, Pa. His ancestors are of German extraction, and settled in 
      the above-named county prior to the Revolutionary war. David, when 
      seventeen years old, entered as an apprentice the tannery of Benjamin 
      Semmel, at Neffville, Lehigh Co., and remained there until 1862, working 
      as a journeyman after having learned his trade. In the last-named year he 
      went to Lehighton and assumed the management of the tannery of Stephen 
      Kissler. This he managed so successfully that when the Kissler Brothers, 
      in 1870, built their large tannery in Lock Haven, he was asked by them to 
      fill the important position of manager thereof, which position he accepted 
      and still retains. It is a very large establishment, and has an average 
      capacity of twelve hundred hides per week. Mr. Mosser married Miss Eliza 
      Houseman, who was born in Lehigh County, and was daughter of Jacob 
      Houseman. Their children are Albert, Oswill B., Elias, Joseph, and Martha. 
      Oswill B. was born in Lehigh County on the 28th day of January, 1854. When 
      seventeen years old he with his father's family removed to Lock Haven, 
      where he met, and on the 25th day of March, 1881, married Miss Alpha Rippy, 
      who was born in Lock Haven, Dec. 29, 1859, and is daughter of Frank and 
      Frances (Stringfeller) Rippy. They have one child, viz., Frank D., born 
      July 1, 1882. When eleven years of age Oswill B. commenced work in the 
      tannery of Stephen Kissler, in which he worked only summers at first and 
      went to school winters. After he was seventeen years old he devoted his 
      entire time to the business, and eventually became skilled in all its 
      branches. In 1848, Col. George Noss built a steam tannery in Nossville, 
      Huntingdon Co., which was operated until 1870, when it was burned down. It 
      was then owned by Messrs. Hense, Reese & Sops, who at once rebuilt it on 
      the foundation of the old one. It was kept in operation until 1878, when 
      it was closed, and remained closed until 1881, when Oswill B. Mosser 
      bought it of Robert Harkison, who had come into possession of it through 
      the Spanogles. It was then in a very dilapidated condition, but has been 
      put in thorough repair, and now gives employment to twenty men, and turns 
      out one hundred and fifty hides per week. Its stock is drawn on wagons to 
      Orbisonia, and from there shipped to all points east and west. Its 
      greatest drawback is the scarcity of bark, which will be obviated upon the 
      completion of railroads now in contemplation. Mr. Mosser is a young man 
      who has made his business a study and loves it, and is now managing his 
      works with skill and marked success.
 
BLAIR'S MILLS is located between the Narrows and Tuscarora Creeks, a 
      short distance above their confluence, and on the northeast border of the 
      township and county. There is at this place a grist- and sawmill, 
      chop-mill, blacksmith- and shoe-shop, and store. The place was settled and 
      the first grist-mill built as early as 1790, and a second mill upon the 
      site of the first, which had been burned, was built as early as 1820, and 
      the present grist-mill built in 1839, upon the site of the two former, by 
      John Blair. He subsequently sold to his son, A. C. Blair, who in 1875 sold 
      the mill to John A. Blair, grandson of John Blair, and is the present 
      owner. The chop- and sumach-mill, built subsequently to the building of 
      the gristmill, is now owned by J. A. Blair.
 
The saw-mill was built by A. C. Blair, and sold subsequently to J. A. 
      Blair, present owner.
 
The store, which is doing quite an extensive business, has passed under 
      several firm-names, as follows: A. C. Blair, A. C. & J. H. Blair, Blair & 
      Morrison, D. H. Morrison, Blair & Morrison, J. A. & J. M. Blair, Blair & 
      Son and J. M. Blair, the present owner, with J. B. Morrow as clerk. One of 
      the blacksmith-shops is owned by J. A. Blair, and operated by Henry Knox, 
      blacksmith; and the other is owned by James Gifford, with John Knox as 
      blacksmith.
 
SHADE VALLEY POST-OFFICE. - This beautiful little hamlet, nestled down 
      among the hills in what is known as Shade Valley, is also known as 
      familiarly by the names of " Silverthorn's Mill" and " Richvale" as by the 
      former name. It is also located on the old Jacob Goshorn tract, and 
      surrounded by rich farming and grazing lands; and although far from any 
      railroad or other public improvement, there is a large amount of business 
      done here, and the thrift of the little town is plain to behold in the 
      neat appearance of the town generally.
 
The first grist-mill at this place was built, as near as can be 
      ascertained, one hundred years ago, and no doubt Jacob Goshorn, the then 
      owner of the land, was the prime mover in the work. Two mills have 
      preceded the present grist-mill, which was built in 1865 or 1866 by 
      Richard Silverthorn, and is still owned by the Silverthorn family.
 
The first store at this place was opened in 1865 by William McFeeter, 
      who had been a sutler in the army. He subsequently sold to --- Kepler, and 
      Kepler sold to --- Parsons, who sold to Messrs. Crawford & McCulloch. The 
      firm-name was again changed to Jones & Birdge, who sold out to --- Blair, 
      and in the spring of 1882 H. S. Thompson became proprietor, also 
      postmaster at the Shade Valley post-office.
 
The first blacksmith at this place was a Mr. Stinson, who was succeeded 
      by - Fogle, and he by J. C. Pyle, the present blacksmith.
 
BOLLINGER TOWN is one of the smallest hamlets in the township, yet is 
      known throughout this section by this name. It is located at the 
      head-waters of Trough Spring Creek, in Shade Valley. There are at this 
      place two or three dwellings and the remains of a school-house.
 
Educational. - There are in Tell township eight school districts, in 
      which were five months' school taught in 1881, with an average attendance 
      of two hundred scholars during the term. Total tax levied in the township 
      for school purposes during the year, $945.60; State appropriation, 
      $199.92; total expenditures during the year, $1028.51. There were eight 
      male teachers employed, at $21 each per month.
