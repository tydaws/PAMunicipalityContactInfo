SEPTIC SYSTEMS
By ordinance, ALL property owners in the Township are required to have their on-site septic systems pumped by a licensed hauler at least once every three years. Having your septic system pumped regularly is the best way to help prevent costly repairs to the system. If you are not sure when your tank was last pumped, please contact the Township.   There is a record of it in the office.  After your septic tank is pumped, a copy of the hauling receipt must be provided to the Township. Do not assume that your pumper will do this. For a list of licensed haulers, please call the Township office.

DRIVEWAY REGULATIONS

Since July 1, 2018, a permit has been required to pave any driveway in West Sadsbury Township. Inspections will be carried out prior to paving and after the job is complete to ensure that it was correctly installed per township specifications.  Contact the Township office for additional information.

 RECYCLING

Please wash the non-paper materials you recycle. Only recycle the items on the Recycle Right Flyer which can be found under the Recycling tab. CONTAMINATION is the issue. When recyclables are clean and separated from trash correctly, there is a market for those items. Only the items shown on the flyer can be recycled. The cost of recycling has risen dramatically and will affect your bottom line.  
WHEN IN DOUBT, THROW IT OUT!

 Keystone Valley Fire Department is always looking for Volunteers along with Career Staff Employees for our Emergency Medical Services.  The hardest part of the Volunteer Fire Service is recruitment and retention. However, we continue to push forward to ensure responses 24/7, 365. The call volume for EMS has increased throughout Chester County for all agencies and with this comes increased services for KVFD.    Keystone Valley Fire Department's training nights are on Monday evenings at 7:00 P.M.  Stop In, see what it is about and how the personnel come together as a team! If it's something you're interested inquire within!  KVFD is always looking for personnel for Administration, Firefighting, Emergency Medical Services, Fire Police and the future of this service which is Junior Firefighters.  For more information follow WWW.KVFD8.COM and also check us out on Facebook.
