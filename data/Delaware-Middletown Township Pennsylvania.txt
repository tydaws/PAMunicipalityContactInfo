Homeowner Composting Information
The Township Council encourages residents to compost as many leaves as possible on their properties as the primary means of leaf disposal, with the bagged collection program available as an alternative where on-lot composting is not practical.  A “How to” brochure on leaf composting was developed by the Township and is available by clicking the headline above.  Other practical links to composting are also available.
