Periodic Single-Lane Closures on Baileys Run Road to Begin April 10








PITTSBURGH – The Department of Public Works announced today that periodic single-lane closures on Baileys Run Road in Frazer, East Deer, and West Deer will begin at 6 a.m. on Monday, April 10, 2023. The restrictions will occur between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. on weekdays, and they are expected to end by November. They are required for milling and paving, base repairs, drainage improvements, shoulder work, and guide rail replacement.


Drivers can expect to experience short stoppages at work zones, and flaggers will be used to control traffic.


Later this year, as part of the same project, Baileys Run Road will be fully closed for the construction of two retaining walls. Traffic will be detoured using Freeport Road, Crawford Run Road, Butler Logan Road, and Russellton Airport Road. Residents living within the closure area will have access to their homes at all times.


The start date for the full closure has yet to be determined. When plans are finalized, that information will be provided to the public via press release, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Nextdoor, and Allegheny Alerts.https://www.alleghenycounty.us/public-works/projects-and-closures.aspxUPDATE: Work has been postponed to a later date to be announced.
