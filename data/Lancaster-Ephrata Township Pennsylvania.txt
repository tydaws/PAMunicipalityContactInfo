Real Estate Taxes
Your real estate taxes are based on the current assessed value of your property multiplied by the current millage rate.  The Spring real estate tax is Municipal and County taxes.  Ephrata Township's 2020 millage rate is 1.27 and Lancaster County's 2020 millage rate is 2.911.  For example, if the assessed value of your property is $100,000, your Township real estate taxes would be $127.00 and your Lancaster County real estate taxes would be $291.10.  The fall real estate tax is School taxes.  The 2019 - 2020 Ephrata Area School District tax millage rate is 17.25.
The municipal millage rate (currently 1.27 mills) is determined by the Board of Supervisors and adopted by Resolution as part of the Township's budget by December 31st of each year.   Your Ephrata Township tax dollars help support 24-hour a day police protection, public work's department services, parks/recreation, and general operating expenses.
All Lancaster County and Ephrata Township real estate taxes are collected by Lancaster County.  Bills are mailed by the County around March 1 of each year.  If you have any questions about your taxes or property assessment, please contact the Lancaster County at 717-299-8222.

LCSWMA - TARP POLICY
07/20/2022 by Steve Sawyer
The Lancaster County Solid Waste Management Authority (LCSWMA) is requiring that all commercial and residential customers transporting waste to any of its facilities use a tarp to secure open loads or face a $20 penalty.  Second offenders will be turned away. 
 
“The health and safety of our community matters,” Robert Zorbaugh, Chief Executive Officer of LCSWMA, said.  “Waste coming loose from unsecured loads is dangerous to drivers and litters our roadways.  Our employees spend countless hours collecting litter from trailers, pick-up trucks and commercial vehicles that aren’t properly tarped.  The objective of the $20 penalty is to change behavior so customers abide by the existing policy,” he added.
 
According to a study by the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, unsecured loads and debris in the road led to 200,000 crashes between 2011-2014.  During that time, debris related vehicle accidents caused 39,000 injuries and 500 deaths.  Data released by the same organization found that as a nation, we spend $11.5 billion combating litter, 40% of which comes from unsecured loads. 
 
LCSWMA officials note that according to Pennsylvania’s State and Federal requirements, it’s also the law to tarp loads.
 
Loads must be covered with a securely fastened water-resistant cover that eliminates potential for littering and other nuisances.25 Pa. Code §§ 285.211(a) and 299.211(a)
