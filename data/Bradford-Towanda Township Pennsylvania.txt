Welcome To Towanda Township

Towanda Township HistoryTowanda was one of the original Townships, which was organized before the establishment of Bradford County.
The American Indians were the first to engage in agriculture in Bradford County.  They cleared patches along the river and the larger creeks where they raised corn, beans, pumpkins, squash, and tobacco.  The first pioneers coming into the wilderness of  Bradford County were chiefly there to start an agricultural lifestyle.
