Tax Rates EXPLAINED 



Local Income Tax is 1.25%.  Of the 1.25% paid by each resident on earned income, .25% is dedicated to the preservation and maintenance of Open Space  in the township and cannot be used for any other purpose.  The Township receives .50% which goes into the Townships General Fund for the main purpose of operating the Police Dept, Roads Dept and Township Administration responsibilities.  The remain .50% of the Township Earned Income Tax goes to the Owen J Roberts School District.Per Capita Tax of $10 per year per resident. This income is dedicated to operating the Police Dept, Roads Dept and Township Administration responsibilities. The Per Capita Tax of $10 is for general revenue purposes on people 18 and over. Individuals may apply for exonerations of such taxes for reasons of low income, double assessments or military service. Questions can be directed to the tax collector Nance Sparks at 610-970-0334.Local Services Tax (LST) is $52. A tax of Fifty-Two ($52.00) Dollars on the privilege of engaging in an occupation in the township. This tax is used for emergency and municipal services. It is collected by Keystone Tax Bureau through employers and direct payment by taxpayers including non-residents. There is an exemption from the tax for anyone whose total income from all sources of employment is less than twelve thousand ($12,000.00) dollars. Questions on this tax can be direct to Keystone Tax Bureau (888-328-0558).  LST OrdinanceReal Estate/Property Tax (3.28 mils)  The millage rate is the amount per $1,000 of the assessed value of a property used to calculate taxes on a property.  The millage rate is multiplied by the total taxable value of the property to arrive at the property taxes due. To determine the rate on every $1,000 of value, multiply the rate by 1,000 or simply move the decimal point three places to the right. Though not required, millage rates are often rounded to two decimal places, which gives you 3.28 mills or $3.28 of tax on every $1,000 of taxable property value.  Formula:  Assessed value/1000 * millage rate=property tax .  For example– $160,000/1000=160, 160*$3.28= $524.80Mercantile Tax The mercantile tax is levied on the gross receipts of businesses within the Township. The mercantile tax is levied on wholesale and retail trade, as well as restaurants. It is also known as the business gross receipts tax, or business privilege tax.  In North Coventry Township the tax is collected by Tri-State Financial Group, LLCContact Info for Mercantile Tax:Robert SchaeferChief Operating OfficerTri-State Financial Group, LLC408 East Fourth Street, Suite 207Bridgeport, PA 19405(610) 270-9520 (office)www.tfgtax.com
