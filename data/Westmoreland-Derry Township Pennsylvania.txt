Derry Township Board of Supervisors
Derry Township is governed by three Supervisors elected by the voters.  Supervisors are elected for a six-year term and serve staggering terms so that at no time is a completely new, inexperienced Board of Supervisors elected.  Supervisors are vested with the executive and legislative powers of the Township.  They determine municipal policy, enact laws and the budget, pay bills, establish tax rates, execute contracts, appoint Township officials, etc.
Derry Township Supervisors meet on the first Tuesday of each month in the Derry Township Municipal Building.  Those wishing to be placed on the agenda are to submit a request in writing five days prior to the meeting.
