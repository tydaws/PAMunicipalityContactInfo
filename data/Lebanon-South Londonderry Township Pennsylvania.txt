Special Announcements
Mt. Gretna Sewer Customers,Subject: Billing / Sewer Rate Changes            At the February 14, 2023 Board of Supervisor’s Meeting, the decision was made to pass on the 6% sewer rate increase received from the Mt. Gretna Borough Sewer Authority to the residents/businesses of South Londonderry Township connected to their sewer system.  The attached bill reflects this quarterly increase with most customers seeing their quarterly bill increase from $179.00 to $190.00.          The other important topic which also impacts each of you as a Mt. Gretna Sewer customer is the consideration that in 2024, these quarterly sewer bills will be consolidated into an annual bill and reflected on the 2024 Lebanon County Real Estate Tax bills.  If you have a mortgage, this sewer bill may be included as a monthly escrow; otherwise, the annual sewer billing will need to be paid to the Lebanon County Tax Collector with your Real Estate payment as per their payment policies.  Mt. Gretna sewer payments will no longer be accepted at the Township Building for these Mt. Gretna sewer customers, if this initiative is approved by the Board of Supervisors.           A final decision may be made at the May 9, 2023 at 7:00PM Board of Supervisors meeting after Mt. Gretna Sewer customers have the opportunity to provide public comment to this possible annual sewer billing change.  The Board of Supervisors encourage your attendance and participation at this upcoming meeting to voice your concerns and/or support.
Mosquito-born Disease Control ProgramRepresentatives for the program will be conducting sample collection in South Londonderry Township to determine what actions to take to mitigate the spread of West Nile Virus.  More information can be found HERE and on our Stormwater page.  
Grant Awards:Campbelltown Park - $70,616 for playground equipment and park improvements.Lawn Fire Co. - $162,081 for driveway improvements and sign replacement.Municipal Authority - $445,241 for a new jet/vac truck.












South Londonderry Township Police K-9, Rex, retired on January 3rd, 2023 after eight years of service to the community. Rex was South Londonderry Township's Firs K-9 officer.  With Rex's retirement, and with our Township commitment to continuing the K-9 program, it is time to purchase and train another dog.  Rex was completely funded through community donations and that is our goal as we embark on another fundraising campaign.  To cover the costs of purchasing, training, equipping and maintaining the new dog, we are setting a fundraising goal of $25,000.  We believe that the K-9 Unit contributes to the safety of every resident and business owner of the community.  We hope that you will consider the K-9 program worthy of a donation.  If you feel so moved, please mail or drop your donations off at the Municipal Building located at 27 West Market Street, Palmyra, PA 17078.
