Welcome to Amwell Township 

Amwell Township, located in Washington County in Southwestern Pennsylvania, has a deep history. Its earliest inhabitants were Native Americans of the Delaware, Shawnee, and Iroquois tribes.
Colonists began to settle on the north fork of Ten Mile Creek as early as 1768 comprised of families from Virginia and New Jersey. Amwell Township was one of the 13 original townships erected in Washington County in 1781. Five villages make up Amwell Township: Amity, Banetown, Glyde, Lone Pine, and Ten Mile.
The history of Amwell Township can be found in the homes, churches, and covered bridges located throughout the Township. At one time, Amwell Township had thirteen covered bridges; there are three covered bridges still standing in Amwell Township: The Bailey Bridge, The Hughes Bridge, and the Martins Mill Bridge.
The Hughes Bridge was built in 1889, crossing the Ten Mile Creek. This covered bridge is popular spot in Amwell Township, especially during the Annual Covered Bridge Festival. This local festival draws crowds seeking out hand-made arts and crafts, historical exhibits, and more. The Annual Covered Bridge Festival is held the third weekend in September each year, making it a great way to kick-off to the autumn season.
The 2010 census boasts the population of Amwell Township of 3,751. There are 76 miles of Township roads, 61.07 miles of state roads, making it the largest Township-maintained roadway system in Pennsylvania.
