The Wood Township Supervisors unanimously adopted a resolution governing property tax waiver provisions during their October session held recently in Robertsdale.Supervisors Tom Love, Anthony Lockard and chairman Kirby Lockard reviewed and approved the resolution for Act 57 of 2022, which took effect Oct. 10, 2022.The resolution is required for municipalities, school districts and counties that levy a real estate tax. The resolution allows tax collectors to implement the provisions of the Act for tax years starting on or after Jan. 1, 2023.






Generally speaking, the legislation permits tax collectors to waive additional charges for real estate taxes under certain conditions, subject to having the required information and documents.The Act has special meaning for individuals residing in a mobile home and manufactured dwellings who lease/rent property on which the structure is located. The passage of the resolution was recommended by the Pennsylvania Association of Township Supervisors, noted chairman LockardTurning to other matters, the supervisors set Trick or Treat Night for 6-8 p.m. Monday, Oct. 31.With winter just around the corner, the supervisors agreed to contact the supervisors of neighboring Wells Township, Fulton County, concerning an agreement between the municipalities that allows Wood Township maintenance personnel to plow a section of Fulton Street in Wood, situated in Fulton County. Roadmaster Love will be talking with the Wells Township supervisors regarding the matter.In other maintenance matters, the supervisor agreed to replace a pipe on Birch Street in Robertsdale before the arrival of winter.A Robertsdale resident inquired about the need for maintenance on Locust Street in Robertsdale. In response, the supervisors noted that the municipality does plow the street, adding that the roadway was the subject of “shaling” sometime back. Love will check on the status of the road.Tax collector Darlene Coy announced that she plans to change the dates taxpayers can stop at the township office to pay their taxes. Coy said she plans to collect taxes at the office for two months out of the year, which will probably take place on Mondays from 6-9 p.m. The new hours will appear on tax bills as well as a note with an explanation.The supervisors learned that the township’s liquid fuels allocation for 2023 will be $24,909.62, which is an increase over 2022’s $24,659.28 allocation.Also announced was the receipt of the Fire Relief Grant of $3,022.26, an increase from 2022’s $2,730.09.It was also learned that the township’s second ARPA installment of $35,122.55 was received.Ron can be reached at dnews@huntingdondailynews.com.
