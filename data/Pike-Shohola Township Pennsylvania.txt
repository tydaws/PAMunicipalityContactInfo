About UsShohola Township, Pennsylvania is a municipality located in Northeast Pennsylvania. Shohola contains an amazing water fall, four lakes and a vast amount of preserved open space comprised of the Delaware State Forest and State game lands which give the Township the feeling of peace and tranquility - which are the two translations of the Native American word Shohola – making our Township the perfect place to live.
