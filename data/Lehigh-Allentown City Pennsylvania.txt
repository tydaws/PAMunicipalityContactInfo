Vendors



	Thank you for your interest in providing goods and/or services to the City of Allentown. The City of Allentown uses Public Purchase, a web based eProcurement service for Vendor Registrations and official solicitations.   Registration through Public Purchase is FREE and allows suppliers to update and change their information at any time. In order to receive notifications from the City, vendors will need to register through the following two-step process:
1 - Register with Public Purchase:
Visit the Public Purchase website to begin the registration process and select the “Free Registration” option.  It can take up to 24 hours to activate your account.  You will receive an email from notices@publicpurchase.com letting you know when your account has been activated.
2 - Register with the City of Allentown:
Once you have received your activation email from Public Purchase, log into the Public Purchase site and accept the terms and conditions of use.  After accepting the terms and conditions, start your registration process with the City.  The City requires that you select the appropriate NIGP Commodity Codes for quote notifications and complete a Product Manufacture Labor Standards Compliance Form and a W-9 form for tax purposes.  It is important that this second part of the registration is complete, or you will not receive notifications of upcoming quote opportunities from the City.


If you need further assistance with the process, please email Purchasing.Agent@AllentownPA.gov. 



















 






Vendor Survey


The Purchasing Department is conducting a survey to better understand how we can improve operations and how we can serve vendors better. Please take a few minutes to take the survey. We appreciate your feedback.

The Mayor



Matt Tuerk

Mayor Tuerk was born in East Stroudsburg in 1975. He spent his first nine years under the watchful eye of his Pop-Pop and Mimi (an immigrant from Cuba) while his parents dedicated themselves to their education. In 1984, the family moved to Boulder, Colorado, where his parents continued their studies. Daily life in a progressive college town taught him the value of equity and diversity. Mayor Tuerk's brilliant “second mom”, Nana Kathleen, reinforced that message, saying “value your whole self, be grateful for your blessings, and there is no difference in people simply because of color; racism is a human-generated distinction, cruel and wrong.
The Mayor's education after high school started in Philadelphia, where DIY punk rock and liberal arts education set the foundation for discovering the value of community and trusting people to develop ingenious solutions to the challenges that they face. Love and curiosity pushed him around the world over the next ten years, including stints in Bellingham, WA; Charleston, SC; Havana, Cuba; Columbia, SC; Managua, Nicaragua.
In South Carolina with his now-wife, Karen, he pursued his love of global commerce by completing his Bachelor of Science in International Business at the College of Charleston before earning an MBA at the Moore School of Business at the University of South Carolina.
Mayor Tuerk had always wanted to return to his Eastern Pennsylvania roots, so in 2004, he and Karen moved to Allentown because they were attracted to the energy and diversity of the city. After taking time off to care for their two daughters, Karen became a lecturer in Environmental Science at Muhlenberg College in 2011. They have two daughters, Amelia and Margot.
In 2008, Mayor Tuerk took a position with the Allentown Economic Development Corporation (AEDC) where he learned the power of building coalitions to solve problems. He helped to establish the Urban Manufacturing Alliance, which is a national coalition of cities dedicated to strengthening their manufacturing economies. He also worked diligently to develop resources at the Bridgeworks Enterprise Center, helping AEDC earn a grant from the Economic Development Administration and a visit from the US Secretary of Commerce in 2012. Additionally, he cofounded the Lehigh Valley’s first coworking space and first community-operated “hackerspace,” where individuals with shared creative pursuits can meet and collaborate.
In 2013, he joined Don Cunningham to transform the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corporation (LVEDC). Starting as the Director of Research and Innovation, he led a data initiative to contextualize the region’s economy for local stakeholders and national developers. As Vice President of Administration, he rebuilt LVEDC’s internal systems and finances, and established a Salesforce platform for managing economic development projects.
After becoming LVEDC’s Vice President of Economic Development in 2015, he led the group in attracting billions of dollars in economic growth in the Lehigh Valley and creating thousands of jobs for its residents. His success in this role led him to become the nationally known spokesperson for economic development in the Lehigh Valley. LVEDC was recognized as a Top 20 Economic Development Organization by Site Selection magazine in 2019, and then again in 2020.
In 2020, Matt stepped down from his position at LVEDC to run for Mayor. He hopes to bring his fresh ideas and experience to the city, build coalitions, and serve all of Allentown’s residents with a government that reflects the city’s incredible diversity.
In his spare time, Mayor Tuerk is a lover of languages and a runner of marathons. He speaks Spanish, Portuguese, and French, and has spent the past three years learning Chinese. His next challenge is Arabic. He began running marathons in 2013 and has completed the distance 18 times, including New York and Chicago. He has run in the Boston Marathon twice, and his personal best of 3:06 in Chicago makes him eligible for the 2021 Boston Marathon.

Neighborhood Improvement Zone (NIZ)



Created by state law in 2011, the NIZ is a special taxing district that encourages development and revitalization in downtown Allentown. The NIZ consists of approximately 128 acres in downtown Allentown and the Waterfront district. All taxes generated in the NIZ (with the exception of school district and city taxes) can be used to pay debt service on any financed improvements within the NIZ.
 
How does the NIZ Work?
More than $1 billion in real estate development has been completed utilizing this unique tax incentive and financing tool to fund the development of an arena, office buildings, shops, restaurants, hotels, and apartments. All potential NIZ projects must be geographically located within the NIZ zone and must go through a pre-qualification, application, and if approved, closing process.

A new, or existing business must make an initial determination of the future incremental increase in tax revenue that will be generated in the NIZ as a result of the proposed improvement project.
Work with a bank to determine the level of financing that can be used using this future tax revenue as collateral.
Apply to the NIZ Authority (ANIZDA) for qualification of your proposed project.
Build your project.
Once in operation, the payment of your taxes associated with the project can go toward payment of the debt service on your project.

Interested in relocating your business to the NIZ? The NIZ has generated several developers that can provide rent credits back to end users. Space is available for retail, commercial, and restaurant use with access to talent and amenities. Contact the Allentown Neighborhood Improvement Zone Development Authority (ANIZDA).
Completed Projects
Butz Corporate Center is an owner-occupied office building with 100,000 sq. ft. of Class A office space available. Tenants have the option of working with the in-house architect to design a “state-of-the-art” space to fit their specific needs. A combination of restaurants and retail occupy the first floor providing on-site options for employee and corporate dining and catering. Butz Corporate Center is located in the heart of the downtown at 840 W. Hamilton Street. Contact Alvin H. Butz, Inc. for more information.

The Trifecta Building is a mixed-use 40,000 SF building located in the heart of Allentown at 612 Hamilton Street. The building is a retrofit of an early 20th century furniture store and warehouse that has been converted into loft-style, class A office space. The building is named for its anchor tenant, Trifecta Technologies, whose company headquarters occupy the top three floors of the building. The additional office consists of three 4,300 SF units on the 2nd and 3rd floors. The ground floor will feature a bistro style restaurant. Please email Jeff Brown for more information.

PPL Center - The NIZ legislation keyed the financing of the construction of the PPL Center, a multi-purpose arena that seats more than 10,000 for concerts and more than 8,500 hockey games, serving as home to the Lehigh Valley Phantoms (Philadelphia Flyer farm team).

Tower 6 is a mixed-use 142,000 SF building located in the heart of Allentown at 600 Hamilton Street is class A office space. The steel and glass construction provides abundant light and panoramic views of the entire city. Tower 6 has several major tenants across 12 floors occupying a mix of collaborative open space and private offices along with a first-floor retail space. Contact City Center Allentown for more information.

Planned Projects
The Waterfront - The Waterfront is the only development site in the Lehigh Valley that provides panoramic water views and direct access to the Lehigh River. Nestled alongside the western bank of the river, the nearly $300 million development will be a 26-acre mixed-use campus comprised of state-of-the-art office buildings, luxurious residences and a lively new restaurant and retail district. The Waterfront will also be a new place for the Valley to discover open space plazas brimming with events and vitality, a peaceful walking and riding path along the river, and a new way to reconnect with the water and the surrounding natural environment.

Da Vinci Science Center at PPL Pavilion is expanding to 8th and Hamilton Streets with its new science center and STEAM education facility. The center will total 67,000 square feet with a learning center, exhibition space, and interactive, immersive displays. Exhibits will include topics such as life science, environment, and manufacturing innovation and the center is expected to attract 400,000 visitors annually.
