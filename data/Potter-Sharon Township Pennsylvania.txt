About Kimberly


Kimberly Bolas Miller
I have been a Trustee for Sharon Township for 9 years.  I was the Fiscal Officer for 8 years prior and have lived in Sharon Township for 47 years….all of my life.  I currently live here with my two children and husband, Denny.
I was raised here by my parents, Emil and Carolyn Bolas who proudly served all of the residents of Sharon Township.
I am a graduate of Highland High School, Class of 1989 and have previously served as a Founding Trustee for the Highland Foundation for Educational Excellence for a time period of roughly 8 years.
I have my Bachelors of Science from the University of Akron in Business Administration/Finance. I am employed by Westfield Bank as a Private Banker and work in Medina.
In the past or currently, I have been involved with the United Way of Medina County, Board of Leadership Medina County, Board of Blue Coats Medina County, Sharon Women’s Club, TEAM Sharon Relay for Life Team and Junior Achievement. I am a Girl Scout Silver Award Recipient.
I firmly believe that Grassroots Government is the most effect form of government and I am proudly a part of a governing body of three trustees who help make Sharon Township what it has been and is today.

My name is Neil Jones and I am the Sharon Township Zoning Inspector. I have held this position since 1996.
