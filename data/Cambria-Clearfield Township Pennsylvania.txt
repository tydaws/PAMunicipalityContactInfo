Clearfield Borough/Lawrence Township Residents:Deer Tick Virus (DTV) Detected at High Levels in Clearfield County Park.
Press-Release from the Pennsylvania Departmentof Environmental Protection Agency
 

Clearfield County was created in 1804, from parts of Huntingdon and Lycoming Counties and named for Clearfield Creek. The creek’s name alluded to openings or “clear-fields” made by the large number of bison in the area. For many years Clearfield County functioned as part of Centre County, not electing its own commissioners until 1812. It was organized for judicial purposes in 1822. Clearfield, the county seat, was incorporated as a borough in 1840.


 

 
Clearfield County is located in the center of Pennsylvania with direct access to major markets in the Northeastern United States and the Midwest via US Interstate 80 which runs directly through the center of the county. There are 6 exits off US Interstate 80 in Clearfield County with 5 of the exits having potential economic development properties available near the exits. Recent additions to the Clearfield County business community include the Wal-Mart Distribution Center located in Bradford Township at old Exit 20 of Interstate 80, the newly-constructed Clearfield Campus of Lock Haven University and the State Correctional Institute at Houtzdale. Economic Development opportunities also exist at the new DuBois Industrial Park.
