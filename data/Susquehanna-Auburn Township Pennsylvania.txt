Zoning DepartmentBeing a semi-rural community, Auburn Township’s zoning was established to provide a firm guide for future controlled growth of our community in a balanced and orderly manner.Auburn Township’s zoning districts were established to help guide our new growth into areas where the growth can be most reasonably supported. The majority of Auburn is zoned residential single family dwellings (about 75%).Auburn has implemented protection for its environmentally sensitive areas and has also zoned for its passive open spaces.  About 20% of Auburn is included in these areas. The remaining areas in the township are zoned for Industrial and Commercial/Business uses.Recent Messages from the Zoning Inspector:All swimming pools must have a zoning permit issued by the Township Zoning Inspector. In-ground pools, must be enclosed by a permanently constructed chain link fence or wall not less than four (4) nor more than six (6) feet in height. These fences or walls must be maintained in a safe and secure condition. All gates shall be self-closing and self-latching with a latch not readily accessible for children to open.Above ground pools over four feet need only be secured at the entrance to the pool, as described above. If there is a deck around the pool, it must be at least four feet off the ground with the opening secured.If your pool falls into any of the above classifications, please arrange to secure it immediately.Agriculture – The Geauga WayGeauga County Planning Commission
