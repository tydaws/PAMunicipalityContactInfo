Chesapeake Conservancy – Envision the Susquehanna
The Envision the Susquehanna initiative was launched by a core team comprised of the Chesapeake Conservancy, the National Park Service, the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Susquehanna River Heartland Coalition for Environmental Studies, Susquehanna Greenway Partnership, and the Wildlife Management Institute in 2013. The core team as well as an advisory council of almost 40 organizations have encouraged individuals, community leaders and organizations to describe their vision for the Susquehanna River watershed. This report details the results of the initial planning process and lays out a vision for the future of the Susquehanna River.
The Homeowners Guide to Stormwater Management
This guide is intended to help property owners evaluate and assess current runoff pathway on their properties and identify practices to better manage stormwater. The guide outlines several practices to choose from that are fairly simple to plan and construct. All efforts have been made to ensure the material in this guide is accurate and up to date.

Welcome to West Manheim Township
West Manheim Township is located in the south west corner of York County Pennsylvania, nestled against the famous Mason-Dixon border. Our growing community of approximately 8,000 residents was founded in the mid-1700’s and officially established as a township by the Commonwealth in February of 1854 by an Act of Assembly of Pennsylvania.  Originally comprised of Pennsylvania Dutch family farms, the area is now growing into a diverse community of quiet, residential neighborhoods, recreational areas, and burgeoning commercial interests.  Presently, the township is made up of 19.9 square miles of land. Within the township, we have two water shed areas which are used as public water sources. West Manheim has 70 miles of road within the township which is maintained by our road crew.  This page has been established to help those interested in learning more about West Manheim Township, as well as to provide information and resources for our residents.
