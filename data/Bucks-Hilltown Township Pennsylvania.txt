The Public Works Department of Hilltown Township consists of Director Thomas “Tommy” Hess, & ten full-time employees. The department is responsible for sustaining the infrastructure of Hilltown Township.  Responsibilities are diverse and complex, covering all four seasons. The eleven person crew is responsible for maintaining over 90 miles of roadway, which consists of but not limited to paving/plowing/salting and patching. They are also in charge of maintaining our parks, storm drains and inlets, mowing, tree trimming, recycling, maintenance of all the equipment used to do the various jobs, and the maintenance of both the public works and the administration buildings.

Snow Removal
The goal of the public works department is to efficiently and safely remove snow and ice from Hilltown Township roadways. Below is a list of ways you can help with keeping the community safe for others.

Do NOT shovel or blow snow into the street or across the street
Clear fire hydrants by your homes
Clear a path for the children to get on the school bus, if applicable
Clear sidewalks
Move vehicles off snow emergency streets. (View snow emergency roads)

The Township will not be liable for the replacement of property if damaged by a Township plow if the property is in the right-of- way and the weight of the snow off the plow is what damaged the property. Please call Tom Hess at 215-453-6000 ext. 230, if you feel that the above statement was not what happened.
Please refer to the Snow/Ice removal ordinance #2007-003, Snow Emergency Ordinance # 2016-004 for more information regarding snow & ice rules in the Township.
Storm Drains & Inlets
Maintaining the storm drains and inlets of debris throughout the Township is an enormous task. Only rain water belongs in the storm drains.
Ordinance No. 2022-003 - Restricting the stockpiling or depositing of yard waste with in the right of way of public streets.
