Noxen, Pennsylvania






























 






      





 
     
  


Built by the lumber and tanning industries in 
	  the 1800's, Noxen has evolved from a busy railroad hub to a picturesque 
	  residential community with plenty of history and small town 
	  charm.  Located in glorious Northeastern Pennsylvania, our town enjoys 
	  natural beauty while offering a central location from which to explore 
	  everything our region has to offer.
