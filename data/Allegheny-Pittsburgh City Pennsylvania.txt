Zoning and Development Review Division
The Division of Zoning and Development Review (Zoning Division) of the Department of City Planning administers the City of Pittsburgh Zoning Code and Historic Preservation Code. The Zoning Division is the first stop for getting most construction permits in the City of Pittsburgh. The approval processes involved vary by project type, the scope of work, and location (see the Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections for more information).

Primary Roles and Responsibilities of the Zoning Division

Regulates land use within the City of Pittsburgh
Reviews interior/exterior renovations, additions/expansions, and new construction
Initiates zone changes and zoning code text amendments
Shapes public realm through the design review process
Establishes and regulates local Historic Designations
Regulates consolidations and subdivisions

 
What are the codes and regulations administered?
The City of Pittsburgh Zoning Code regulates land use and activities within the City boundaries. The intent of zoning regulations is to allow property owners the reasonable use of their property insofar as the use is not detrimental to abutting properties or to the neighborhood. The City of Pittsburgh is divided into different Zoning Districts that regulate the potential uses of a property. Interactive maps show the zoning and parcel information. 
Note: the current Certificate(s) of Occupancy for particular property documents explain how that property is legally allowed to be used.

The City of Pittsburgh Zoning Code (Title 9) is hosted by Municode, found here.
The City of Pittsburgh’s Historic Preservation Code (Title 11) is hosted by Municode here. Additional guidelines can be found here.
The Subdivision Regulations and Standards of the City Planning Commission govern all consolidations and subdivisions in the City of Pittsburgh.

Legislative Information Center
Welcome to the City of Pittsburgh's Legislative Information Center (LIC)!

LAUNCH

City Council takes pride in its open form of government and is pleased to provide state-of-the-art technology to assist the public in tracking and retrieving legislation.
Below you will find three tabs: Legislation, Video Streaming, and Meeting Calendar. Please click on each tab and view some information we've assembled about using the LIC.
Note: Official, certified copies can be obtained in person from the City Clerk's Office.
Searching for Legislation
In the LIC, the Legislation page  is a common starting point for users. You may search the legislation database by keyword, by year, by type, and more by means of an advanced search interface (you will see the Advanced Search link to the right of the search controls). More detailed help with searching is available here .
After you initiate a search, your results are returned in rows below the search interface. Legislative File numbers are hyperlinked to Detail pages.
Detail pages
A Legislative Detail page contains a wealth of information about a specific piece of legislation - sponsors, titles, committee of control, etc. Any attachments to the legislation are available here.
The Legislative Detail page is where you can track Actions taken as the file moves through the legislative process. You can see how votes were cast by clicking Action Details. All details of the meeting are linked to - click Meeting Details.
After meetings take place, the City Clerk's office works hard to edit and archive Meeting Video. When the video clip has been archived, you will find a link on the Legislative Detail page. For more help with video, please go to the Video Streaming tab above.
QUICK HELP & HINTS





When searching for legislation, make sure to check what year you are searching. The search control defaults to the current year. You may track specific legislation and receive updates via RSS. Look for the RSS icon: 










ATTACHMENT FILES
Legislative attachments are posted in .doc format. For many users, these files will open in Microsoft Word. If you do not have Word, then please be aware that many free alternatives exist. For example, OpenOffice.org is an excellent free choice available for all major operating systems.










OTHER FILES
Many other files in the LIC are offered in PDF format. Most users probably have a PDF Reader configured - but a variety of readers for all major operating systems are available here :

Earned Income Tax - Employer Withholding   


Earned Income Tax - (Employer Withholding) is collected by Jordan Tax Service
WHAT IS TAXED?
Under Pennsylvania Earned Income Tax law, all residents of the City of Pittsburgh must have three (3%) percent of their wages withheld from their pay as Earned Income Tax. This amount is to be remitted to Jordan Tax Services. This applies whether the employer is located within or outside the City of Pittsburgh. The determining factor is the residency of the employee, not the location of the employer.
If insufficient amounts are withheld by employers, City residents are required to pay the difference when EIT tax returns are filed with Jordan Tax Services. Jordan Tax Services is the agent for EIT Tax collection for the Allegheny County Central Tax District.
TAX RATE: City of Pittsburgh residential; City 1%, School district 2%. 3% Total

Payroll Expense Tax   


DUE DATE:The last day of the second month after quarter end for the prior quarters’ activity.
TAX RATE: 5½ Mills (.0055) or .55%
WHO PAYS THE TAX?
All persons who engage, hire, employ, or contract with one or more individuals, as employees, to perform work or render services within the City of Pittsburgh. The Payroll Tax is computed on the employer’s total payroll expense (total compensation) associated with business activity in the City.  Partners are considered employees of the employer for purposes of the Payroll Tax.  You do not need to be located in the City of Pittsburgh to be subject to this tax.
 
DO SELF-EMPLOYED PERSONS AND PARTNERS HAVE TO PAY THE TAX?
Yes, self-employed persons and partners in a partnership, if the partnership otherwise does not remit the tax, must file the tax return and remit the tax on their own earnings. In calculating the earnings of self-employed persons or partners, such earnings are the sum of guaranteed payments and the lesser of net profits or net draws or distributions from the business. Passive income received by a self-employed person or a partner is not subject to tax because it is not considered “earned” income.
 
IMPORTANT DATES
Employers must file quarterly reports with the City Treasurer on or before the last day of the second month after the quarter, reporting the preceding quarter’s activity on the Payroll Expense Tax Form provided at https://pittsburghpa.gov/finance/tax-forms. Thus, 1st Quarter taxes and reports are due May 31st, 2nd Quarter; taxes and reports are due August 31st, 3rd Quarter taxes and reports are due November 30th, and 4th Quarter taxes and reports are due February 28th of the following year.

What is taxed?

Payroll Expense Tax FAQs at https://pittsburghpa.gov/finance/tax-faqs

What if my employees don’t just work in the City of Pittsburgh?
For employers whose employees perform work or render services partly within and partly outside of the City of Pittsburgh, the method of computing their payroll expense attributable to the City of Pittsburgh is to use the percentage of total number of working hours employed within the City of Pittsburgh compared to the total number of hours employed (within and outside) the City for each individual employee.  Detailed examples are provided in the Regulations.
