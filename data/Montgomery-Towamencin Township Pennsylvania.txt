Frequently Asked Questions





Proposed Sale or Lease of Sanitary Sewer System
Sewer System Evaluation Background
Monetization of Assets – After an independent study (Hazen & Sawyer) of the collection and treatment systems, completed several years ago, there were initial concerns whether the existing system would be able to meet future permit limit requirements without significant capital expenditures. The question was raised whether the Township should consider “monetization” (selling) of the system as other Pennsylvania municipalities and authorities have done recently. Monetization is the process of converting assets into economic value.
These other municipalities had concerns similar to Towamencin - that their systems needed millions of dollars of improvements to bring them up to current state and federal standards with possibly millions more needed to accommodate future mandates by the federal government. In order to determine whether there are better alternatives to achieve these results, and at the same time achieve financial benefits for the community, these municipalities conducted a detailed independent financial analysis.
Sewer Committee recommendation
On September 3, 2020, representatives of Public Financial Management (“PFM”) attended the Sewer Committee’s meeting to review the process of evaluating the sewer system and whether monetization is a worthwhile option. The Committee agreed that it is the responsible and prudent action to examine whether it is in the Township’s best interest, or not, to monetize the sanitary sewer system and recommended that an “Analysis & Valuation” study of the sanitary sewer system be conducted to collect the needed information to make an informed decision on monetization. Public Financial Management (PFM) submitted a proposal for an Analysis & Valuation study and presented background on the company and reviewed the monetizing sewer system concept and process to the Committee (and to the Board of Supervisors at their September 23rd meeting), and why municipalities consider the service.
Board of Supervisors approve valuation study of sewer system



Phase 1 Agreement



At their meeting on September 23rd meeting, the Board of Supervisors accepted Public Financial Management’s proposal to perform a sanitary sewer system analysis and valuation study for $9,500.

Public Valuation Presentation Materials



At the Board’s January 13, 2021 meeting, PFM representatives reviewed the asset exploration process along with the approximate timeline. In Phase 1, described as a preliminary limited-scope evaluation, the system was evaluated using three evaluation methods: cost, income, and market approach. The cost approach combined the overall sewer capital assets and depreciation. The income approach assigns values based on future income estimates generated from the system, such as future rates, future treatment/capital expenses, future Township growth, inflation and sewage disposal costs. The market approach included compiling values derived from comparing financial metrics to similar transactions, such as geography, size, collection only vs. collection and treatment services. 
An overview of Phase 2 and 3 was provided. A sample timeline was included if the Township authorized Phase 2 and 3. Upper Gwynedd Township’s intention of becoming fully autonomous with their wastewater system, as part of a capital improvement plan, was noted as it will create a financial impact to the Township with the lost revenue.
With the completion of Phase 1, the next step was to examine whether it is advantageous to enter into a public/private or public/public asset sale of the sewer system. This process would require two additional phases. Phase 2 includes the preparation of documents, including drafting and distribution of requests for qualifications, outreach to potential investors and/or system operators to confirm market interest in the assets, establishment of a timeline for a possible transaction, and identification of key issues to be resolved. Professional hourly rates range from $150-$350 per hour, which would be deferred as part of a potential sale. Phase 3 includes coordinating the sale transaction and closing process, should that decision be made, and developing a plan to effectively deploy the proceeds from the monetization.
Public Financial Management submitted a proposed agreement to provide these services at an hourly rate for Phase 2 and a charge not to exceed 0.70 percent of a final closing price. If there is no transaction, the fees for both Phase 2 and Phase 3 will not be charged. The Board of Supervisors agreed they have an obligation of due diligence to continue exploring the sewer monetization process for Towamencin taxpayers.

Phase 2 & 3 Agreement



At their meeting on January 13, 2021, the Board of Supervisors approved Phase 2 and 3 of the agreement with Public Financial Management for financial advisory services related to the Township’s sanitary sewer system.

The following services and information are available at the Towamencin Township Police Department's Administrative Office, Monday through Friday from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM:
Accident Reports
Please visit the www.crashdocs.org to request an Accident Report
Police Incident Reports
Police incident report copies can be released under the Pennsylvania Right to Know Law. Copies can be obtained by completing a "Right To Know Form" available at police headquarters or downloaded from the Documents and Forms page. The charge for report copies are 25 cents per page. Police investigative reports can only be released by court order.
Parking Tickets & Citations
Parking tickets may be paid by mail by sending a check or money order, along with the parking ticket, to the Towamencin Township Police Department, 1090 Troxel Road, Lansdale, PA 19446 or in person at the Police Department Office during regular hours.
If you desire to plead "not guilty" to a parking ticket and would like to request a hearing, please wait until you receive a citation in the mail; however, please be advised that if you are found guilty at the hearing, the cost will be substantially increased from the cost of the original parking ticket.
All traffic and non-traffic citations must be paid by pleading "guilty" on the citation and then sending the fine and costs listed to the District Court on the citation. Those who wish to request a hearing for any traffic or non-traffic citation should plead "not guilty" on the citation and then send that part of the citation to District Court requesting a hearing date.
Fingerprinting
Fingerprinting for employment purposes, name changes, etc. can be performed for Towamencin Township residents and businesses by utilizing the booking center, now located at the Lansdale Police Department, 1 Vine Street, Lansdale PA. 
Non-residents of Lansdale are charged a fee of $35.00. Fingerprinting is done by appointment only. Please contact the Lansdale Police Department's non-emergency number at (215) 368-1801 to schedule an appointment. Fingerprinting cannot be performed at the booking center for immigration purposes. Please contact your nearest Immigration Department for a listing of their offices.
Alarms
All individuals and businesses that possess burglary/security or other types of alarms are mandated by Township Ordinances to register their alarms with the police department at an annual fee of $25.00. You will be billed by the Township Finance Department when the annual fee is due.
Please visit the Documents and Forms page to download an Alarm Permit Application
Soliciting & Vendor Permits
Solicitor or vendor permits can be obtained at the police department utilizing the following guidelines:
If you are planning on soliciting door-to-door attempting to sell a product where you will be taking payments or deposits, or otherwise distributing pamphlets or business flyers, a permit and fee payment is required. You will need to present a driver's license, Pennsylvania Identification Card or other forms of identification at the time of application. You will also be required to complete a background check before the permit is approved and issued.
If you are soliciting for non-profit or charitable organizations or groups the permits are no charge. However, you must still register with the Police Department and each individual must have identification and will be issued a permit card at time the application is approved.
You can obtain general information on this or any other matters by calling the Towamencin Township Police Department Office at (215) 368-7606.
Please visit the Documents and Forms page to download an Soliciting Permit Application
Police Department Tours & Public Appearances
The Towamencin Township Police Department provides tours of the police facilities for schools, community groups or other organizations upon request. Anyone interested in arranging a tour should contact Ms. Sandy Schwenk at (215) 368-7606 during normal business hours. Anyone interested in having an officer speak to a community group about law enforcement may also schedule an officer's appearance by contacting Ms. Schwenk as well.

To contact someone in the Police Department Administrative Office directly, dial: (215) 368-7606. This telephone number should be used only for administrative or business needs or to contact a specific Towamencin Township Police Department officer or employee.
9-1-1 is a 3 digit emergency number that is easy to remember. It will provide you with immediate and direct access to fire, police and medical services.
When to use 9-1-1:
9-1-1 should be used to report any situation that requires immediate response of a fire truck, police officer or ambulance. DO NOT call 9-1-1 for weather information, household problems, legal advice, nuisance complaints, the time, or for any other reason which is not an emergency. 

 
When you dial 9-1-1 the operator will need to know the following:

The phone number you are calling from
The address you are calling from
The nature of your emergency
Any other information as required

When dialing 9-1-1 do not hang up, even if you have misdialed the phone. Wait for the operator to reply to your call. Speak slowly and clearly. Many times callers will become loud or over-excited during an emergency. It is important for everyone concerned that you try to remain calm and provide the operator with the information he or she needs to properly take care of your call.
