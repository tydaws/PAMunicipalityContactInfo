We love helping our customers! So how can we help your business thrive?








 I want to commend the team at HIG. Removing and installing 10 copiers can be a challenge but it all went very well! The customer service and communication has been outstanding! I work with two other fleet vendors and HIG has been a breath of fresh air!
Carrie M., Wilkes University 






 With a project this extensive, you might expect hiccups, but there weren’t any. HIG was organized and the process went smoothly. The Chain of Custody Agreement also provides comfort. You know your documents are secure.
Mike G., West Hanover Township 






 I’m passionate about helping my clients plan for their future. I recognized the importance of digital marketing but creating and executing a campaign was outside of my expertise. Higher Information Group stepped in ready to hit the ground running. I’m beyond pleased with the results and look forward to working with them well into the future.
Michael Cherewka, Cherewka Law 






 I have been a customer with HIG for nearly 10 years. In a crisis they show a “can-fix” attitude and I sleep well at night trusting HIG with all my IT, web, copying, printing, and shredding needs. They have never let me down.
Justin McShane, Esq., The McShane Firm 






 Special thanks to the HIG security camera installation team! Their teamwork, professionalism, attention to detail and support were above and beyond! Bravo!
Stacy U., Amphenol FCI USA, LLC 






 Our new phones were installed yesterday. I want to put in a word for the technicians that were here. They were exceptional and had us very well-versed in the use of the new system before they left. Very professional and very much appreciated!
G. Bakare, Bakare Associates OB/GYN 






 I LOVE this copier! HIG is amazing! Anything goes wrong with the copier I just make a phone call and it’s taken care of. You guys are amazing!
Tina, William Penn Renovations
