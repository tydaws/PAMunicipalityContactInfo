Dunnstable Twp. super. elected  to state township association’s  executive committee

Corey Lucas 
DUNNSTABLE — Members of the Pennsylvania State Association of Township Supervisors elected Corey J. Lucas, vice chair of the board of supervisors for Dunnstable Township in Clinton County, to a three-year term on the association’s Executive Committee.
The election took place during PSATS’ 2023 Annual Educational Conference and Exhibit Show, held April 23-26 in Hershey. This is the largest municipal event of its kind in the state, with more than 3,500 attendees. The conference attracted township officials from every county in Pennsylvania.
The seven-member Executive Committee, the association’s five officers and the immediate past president make up the Executive Board, which is responsible for managing the affairs of the state association. The board meets frequently throughout the year to oversee association business and plan new projects that will benefit member townships.
The Pennsylvania State Association of Township Supervisors represents Pennsylvania’s 1,454 townships of the second class and is committed to preserving and strengthening township government and securing greater visibility and involvement for townships in the state and federal political arenas. Townships of the second class cover 95 percent of Pennsylvania’s land mass and represent more residents — nearly 5.7 million — than any other type of political subdivision in the commonwealth.
Lucas is second vice president of the Clinton County Association of Township Officials. He serves as roadmaster, dirt and gravel coordinator and police liaison in the township.
