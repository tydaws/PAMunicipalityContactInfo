 Welcome to Shade Township! I am the coordinator 
for these pages.  I have been researching in Somerset County--Particularly in 
Shade Township and surrounding area--for over 10 years.  I have collected a wealth 
of information and am familiar with most of the early pioneers of Shade. I do not live 
local to the area so am in need of volunteers for local data and photos.
I would like to see this site grow with information----FROM YOU!

History of the Township 
The following information is taken from the book "Shade Township, 1762-1962" by Leroy N. Baldwin. The Shade-Central City Historical Society has Mr. BaldwinÂ’s books on sale at their museum in Central City.  You can call Sandy Wojcik, president of the society at 814-754-5675 or Maryann Naret, keeper of the museum at 814-754-4997 to purchase a copy. 
Shade township was incorporated in 1816. The township was
first settled in 1772 and was formed from Stoneycreek Township,
which was one of the six original townships in Somerset County.
Shade Township is located in the north-eastern portion of the
county. It is bounded to the north by Ogle and Paint Townships;
to the west by Quemahoning Township; to the south by Stoneycreek
Township; and to the east by Bedford County. The main Borough of
Shade Township is Central City which was first settled in 1848
and was incorporated on 6 May 1918. Hooversville, which sits
astride the border of Shade and Quemahoning Townships was first
settled in 1836 and was incorporated in 1896. 
The Founding of Shade Township 
The province of Pennsylvania was acquired by the Penn
brothers, William and John, from King Charles II of England, in
payment of a debt the king owed their father, Admiral John Penn,
for which William received a charter from King Charles II, dated
March 4, 1681. 
William divided his province into three counties, which he
often spoke of as the three counties on the Delaware, namely,
Chester, Philadelphia, and Bucks. 
Because of the rapid increase of settlements on the western
frontier it soon became apparent that a new county should be
formed from the western part of Chester County for the
convenience of the inhabitants of the newly settled region.
Therefore the new county of Lancaster was set up in 1729. 
The westward movement of settlements still continued and soon
another new county, Cumberland County, was formed from the
western part of Lancaster County, in 1750. 
And with the continued advance westward, Bedford County was
erected in 1771, from a part of Cumberland County. 
Almost twenty-five years later, the inhabitants of the western
section of Bedford County, lying west of the Allegheny Mountains,
petitioned the General Assembly of Pennsylvania to form a new
county. 
These people living west of the mountains stated in their
petition that the great mountain wall or escarpment formed an
almost inaccessible barrier to communication and trasportation
between the two regions, also claiming that they were almost
remote from the county courts and the public offices of the
county (Bedford). 
As a result of these petitions and the insistence of the
inhabitants of this western section, the General Assembly passed
an act on April 17, 1795, whereby all that part of Bedford County
lying west of the Allegheny Mountains became a new county called
Somerset. 
Somerset County at the time of its organization included all
of Cambria County as far north as the "Old Purchase
Line," north of Ebensburg, and consisted of six townships,
namely, Stonycreek, Quemahoning, Turkeyfoot, Milford, Elk Lick,
and Brothersvalley. 
The township in which we are principally interested at the
present time was Stonycreek Township. Shade Township, including
what is now all of Paint Township and Ogle Township, was
organized from the northern part of Stonycreek Township in 1814.

Towns and Villages 
Central City Borough 
Central City, the only incorporated town in Shade Township, is
situated on lands originally owned by the township's first
settlers, Casper Stotler and George Lambert. It was founded in
1894 by Anthony Wechtenhiser and received its name from its
central location along the projected Midland Railroad. The
objective was to build a railroad into the large coal field known
to exist in this region. The projected railroad, under a
preliminary survey made in 1894, would have extended the road
southeast along Dark Shade Creek and Shingle Run valleys, across
the mountain by way of Frazier's Gap, into Bedford County and
eastward to the Atlantic seaboard. However, the project failed to
develop. In 1913 an extension to the town was laid out by the
Cook and Neasley Realty Company on lands then owned by John
Wechtenhiser and Obadiah Lohr. The town was incorporated into the
borough of Central City in 1918. The present population is about
2,700. 
The inhabitants of Central City borough and the surrounding
area are served by nine churches, sixteen stores, one hotel, five
garages and service stations, three barber shops, a printing
house, a photo studio, two funeral homes, a greenhouse, two
veterans' organizations-American Legion and Veterans of Foreign
Wars, and one financial institution--Central City Bank, a branch
of the United States National Bank of Johnstown. 
The Central City Volunteer Fire Company provides efficient
fire protection for both the borough and the surrounding area.
The Central City post office was established in 1919, with Joseph
Lohr as the first postmaster. A new post-office building was
erected in 1962, and Joseph Kudasik, Jr., is the present
postmaster. Free mail service was established in the borough in
1955. Free public recreation facilities are owned by the borough,
such as a tennis court, baseball held, swimming pool, and a
well-maintained park. The Municipal Building, owned by the
borough, contains a mayor's office, an office for the chief of
police, a council chamber, a large community hall, and a prison
room. It also houses the equipment of the fire company. 
Cairnbrook 
In the central part of Shade Township is a mining town laid
out in 1912 by the Lolayhanna Coal and Coke Company on the Jacob
McGregor Farm. It is located on the west bank of Dark Shade Creek
along State Route 160. It is the largest unincorporated town in
Shade Township, with a present population of 750. The Cairnbrook
post office was established here in 1914. The first postmaster
was Charles Severn and the present one is Jennings Reitz (as of
1964). The Shade-Central City Union, Junior-Senior High, and
elementary schools are located here. The Graef Lutheran Church
and parsonage were erected here in 1917-18 at the corner of
McGregor Avenue and Third Street. Dorfman and Hoffman established
a clothing factory here in 1955, which employs approximately 185
workers at the present time. 
Cairnbrook, although not incorporated, owns and operates its
own water company, sewers and disposal plant, and street
lighting, under the management of the Cairnbrook Improvement
Company, Inc. Each property owner is a stockholder in the
company. All streets are hard-surfaced and lighted. 
Reitz #2 
Reitz #2, a small mining town east of Cairnbrook, just off
Route 160, was laid out on the Thomas Mock Farm in 1916 by the
Reitz Coal Company. 
Reitz #3 and #4 
Reitz #3 and #4 are small mining towns southeast of Central
City, along Dark Shade Creek. Reitz #3 was laid out by John
Lochrie in 1916 on the George Manges Farm. Reitz # 4 was laid
laid out under the management of the Reitz Coal Company in
1918-19 on the Moses Walker Farm. It is the second largest town
in Shade Township. 
Wilbur 
Wilbur is a small mining town in the western part of the
township, one-half mile off Route 53. The town was founded by the
Wilbur Coal Mining Company in 1912 on lands formerly owned by
Daniel Peterman and J. E. Johnson. The Otterbein United Brethren
Church and cemetery are located here. 
Rockingham 
Rockingham is a small mining village along Dark Shade Creek on
State Route 160. The village is located on the site of the old
Rockingham Iron Furnace, erected in 1841. The village was rebuilt
in 1916 by William Gahagen. The Rockingham post office was
eastablished in 1922. 
Gahagen 
Gahagen is a small mining village in the southeastern part of
the township. It was established by the Gahagen Coal Company in
1919. The post office was established in 1922 and closed in 1956.

Buckstown 
Buckstown is a small village in the southern part of Shade
Township. The village is located along the Lincoln Highway, formerly known as
the Pittsburgh-Philadelphia Turnpike and in colonial times as the
"Pennsylvania Road." The part of this village that is south of the Pennsylvania Road is in Stonycreek Township.
Israel Burket bought a tract of land here in 1788 from James Wells. Israel's farm was situated right in what would later be called Buckstown on both sides of the Lincoln Highway. He built a 20'x 30' two story cabin on which he was taxed in 1798. If you look at the  1792 Reading Howell map  of the area, Buckstown was at that time called "Burket's" and Stoystown was simply called "Stoy's." 
John Lambert built a house here in 1805. After the
opening of the turnpike in 1817, Mr. Lambert built and operated a
tavern in the village. Later, when travel became very heavy over
the road, he decided to build houses and shops for a number of
the mechanics who came here to live and work. 
Some of these newcomers were William Small, who became the
town's first blacksmith, and Henry Buck, a wagonmaker who came to
live in the village in 1820. Mr. Lambert also erected a store
building, which he leased to John Stotler. Stotler named the
village in honor of his friend, Henry Buck. Daniel Wagner, a
grandson of Michael Wagner, one of Shade Township's pioneer
settlers, owned and operated a store in Buckstown for more than
fifty years. Mr. Wagner also served as postmaster of the
Buckstown post office for more than twenty-five years until it
was closed in 1909. St. Paul's Lutheran Church was erected in
Buckstown in 1889 and the Lutheran congregation was organized on
April 6, 1890. The charter members of the church were: C. W.
Williamson, Levi B. Manges, C. A. Wagner, Ellsworth Ling, John
Giger, and Charles W. Lambert. Reverend A. R. Shertz served as
the church's first pastor and received an annual salary of $550.

History of the Township 
The following information is taken from the book "Shade Township, 1762-1962" by Leroy N. Baldwin. The Shade-Central City Historical Society has Mr. BaldwinÂ’s books on sale at their museum in Central City.  You can call Sandy Wojcik, president of the society at 814-754-5675 or Maryann Naret, keeper of the museum at 814-754-4997 to purchase a copy. 
Shade township was incorporated in 1816. The township was
first settled in 1772 and was formed from Stoneycreek Township,
which was one of the six original townships in Somerset County.
Shade Township is located in the north-eastern portion of the
county. It is bounded to the north by Ogle and Paint Townships;
to the west by Quemahoning Township; to the south by Stoneycreek
Township; and to the east by Bedford County. The main Borough of
Shade Township is Central City which was first settled in 1848
and was incorporated on 6 May 1918. Hooversville, which sits

Central City, the only incorporated town in Shade Township, is
situated on lands originally owned by the township's first
settlers, Casper Stotler and George Lambert. It was founded in
1894 by Anthony Wechtenhiser and received its name from its
central location along the projected Midland Railroad. The
objective was to build a railroad into the large coal field known
to exist in this region. The projected railroad, under a
preliminary survey made in 1894, would have extended the road
southeast along Dark Shade Creek and Shingle Run valleys, across
the mountain by way of Frazier's Gap, into Bedford County and
eastward to the Atlantic seaboard. However, the project failed to
develop. In 1913 an extension to the town was laid out by the
Cook and Neasley Realty Company on lands then owned by John
Wechtenhiser and Obadiah Lohr. The town was incorporated into the
borough of Central City in 1918. The present population is about
2,700. 
The inhabitants of Central City borough and the surrounding
area are served by nine churches, sixteen stores, one hotel, five
garages and service stations, three barber shops, a printing
house, a photo studio, two funeral homes, a greenhouse, two
veterans' organizations-American Legion and Veterans of Foreign
Wars, and one financial institution--Central City Bank, a branch
of the United States National Bank of Johnstown. 
The Central City Volunteer Fire Company provides efficient
fire protection for both the borough and the surrounding area.
The Central City post office was established in 1919, with Joseph
Lohr as the first postmaster. A new post-office building was
erected in 1962, and Joseph Kudasik, Jr., is the present
postmaster. Free mail service was established in the borough in
1955. Free public recreation facilities are owned by the borough,
such as a tennis court, baseball held, swimming pool, and a
well-maintained park. The Municipal Building, owned by the
borough, contains a mayor's office, an office for the chief of
police, a council chamber, a large community hall, and a prison
room. It also houses the equipment of the fire company. 
Cairnbrook 
In the central part of Shade Township is a mining town laid
out in 1912 by the Lolayhanna Coal and Coke Company on the Jacob
McGregor Farm. It is located on the west bank of Dark Shade Creek
along State Route 160. It is the largest unincorporated town in
Shade Township, with a present population of 750. The Cairnbrook
post office was established here in 1914. The first postmaster
was Charles Severn and the present one is Jennings Reitz (as of
1964). The Shade-Central City Union, Junior-Senior High, and
elementary schools are located here. The Graef Lutheran Church
and parsonage were erected here in 1917-18 at the corner of
McGregor Avenue and Third Street. Dorfman and Hoffman established
a clothing factory here in 1955, which employs approximately 185
workers at the present time. 
Cairnbrook, although not incorporated, owns and operates its
own water company, sewers and disposal plant, and street
lighting, under the management of the Cairnbrook Improvement
Company, Inc. Each property owner is a stockholder in the
company. All streets are hard-surfaced and lighted.

Reitz #2, a small mining town east of Cairnbrook, just off
Route 160, was laid out on the Thomas Mock Farm in 1916 by the
Reitz Coal Company. 
Reitz #3 and #4 
Reitz #3 and #4 are small mining towns southeast of Central
City, along Dark Shade Creek. Reitz #3 was laid out by John
Lochrie in 1916 on the George Manges Farm. Reitz # 4 was laid
laid out under the management of the Reitz Coal Company in
1918-19 on the Moses Walker Farm. It is the second largest town
in Shade Township. 
Wilbur 
Wilbur is a small mining town in the western part of the
township, one-half mile off Route 53. The town was founded by the
Wilbur Coal Mining Company in 1912 on lands formerly owned by
Daniel Peterman and J. E. Johnson. The Otterbein United Brethren
Church and cemetery are located here. 
Rockingham 
Rockingham is a small mining village along Dark Shade Creek on
State Route 160. The village is located on the site of the old
Rockingham Iron Furnace, erected in 1841. The village was rebuilt
in 1916 by William Gahagen. The Rockingham post office was
eastablished in 1922. 
Gahagen 
Gahagen is a small mining village in the southeastern part of
the township. It was established by the Gahagen Coal Company in
1919. The post office was established in 1922 and closed in 1956.

Buckstown 
Buckstown is a small village in the southern part of Shade
Township. The village is located along the Lincoln Highway, formerly known as
the Pittsburgh-Philadelphia Turnpike and in colonial times as the
"Pennsylvania Road." The part of this village that is south of the Pennsylvania Road is in Stonycreek Township.
Israel Burket bought a tract of land here in 1788 from James Wells. Israel's farm was situated right in what would later be called Buckstown on both sides of the Lincoln Highway. He built a 20'x 30' two story cabin on which he was taxed in 1798. If you look at the  1792 Reading Howell map  of the area, Buckstown was at that time called "Burket's" and Stoystown was simply called "Stoy's." 
John Lambert built a house here in 1805. After the
opening of the turnpike in 1817, Mr. Lambert built and operated a
tavern in the village. Later, when travel became very heavy over
the road, he decided to build houses and shops for a number of
the mechanics who came here to live and work. 
Some of these newcomers were William Small, who became the
town's first blacksmith, and Henry Buck, a wagonmaker who came to
live in the village in 1820. Mr. Lambert also erected a store
building, which he leased to John Stotler. Stotler named the
village in honor of his friend, Henry Buck. Daniel Wagner, a
grandson of Michael Wagner, one of Shade Township's pioneer
settlers, owned and operated a store in Buckstown for more than
fifty years. Mr. Wagner also served as postmaster of the
Buckstown post office for more than twenty-five years until it
was closed in 1909. St. Paul's Lutheran Church was erected in
Buckstown in 1889 and the Lutheran congregation was organized on
April 6, 1890. The charter members of the church were: C. W.
Williamson, Levi B. Manges, C. A. Wagner, Ellsworth Ling, John
Giger, and Charles W. Lambert. Reverend A. R. Shertz served as
the church's first pastor and received an annual salary of $550.
