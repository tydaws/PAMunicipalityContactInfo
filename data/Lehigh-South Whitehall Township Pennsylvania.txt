Pets and Animals


Are there limits on the number of pets for a household?
South Whitehall does not limit the number of small domesticated companion animals which are sheltered, fed and exercised within cages or containers within a dwelling unit and not permitted to move freely within the Dwelling, Building or Structure, such as but not limited to domesticated rodents, fish, reptiles, and some birds. This shall not include animals raised or kept for agricultural or farming purposes, venomous or poisonous animals, Wild or Exotic Animals, feral animals, and wild/domestic animal hybrids.
South Whitehall does limit the number of House Pets (specifically dogs, cats, ferrets, Vietnamese Pot-Bellied Pigs, and rabbits) that are kept, fed and sheltered in a Dwelling Unit but may be exercised outdoors.  The housing of as many as six House Pets over three months old within a Dwelling Unit is permitted.
South Whitehall also limits the number of pets (specifically dogs, cats, ferrets, Vietnamese Pot-Bellied Pigs, and rabbits) that may be kept outside of a dwelling unit.  The outdoor housing of as many as four Pets over three months old shall not be within the front yard and shall be no closer than four feet to a Lot Line and not closer than twenty  feet to a Dwelling on an adjoining premise is permitted.
The outdoor housing of as many as five but not more than eight Pets over three months old shall not be within the front yard and shall be no closer than one hundred feet to a Lot Line and not closer than two hundred feet to a Dwelling on an adjoining premise.
The outdoor housing of as many as nine Pets but not more than twelve pets more than three months old shall not be within the front yard and shall be no closer than two hundred feet to a Lot Line and not closer than four hundred feet to a Dwelling on an adjoining premise.
Chickens.  The keeping of up to four chickens (hens only) as pets is permitted on a lot that contains a Single Detached Dwelling Unit residence  located in one of the following districts: the RR-3, RR-2, or R-R Rural Residential and Agriculture.  When outdoors, such hens shall be contained in an enclosed structure, a fenced area or run or a combination thereof. The containment area and/or Structure shall not be permitted in the front yard and shall be Setback at least ten feet from rear and Side Yard Lot Lines, and be at least one hundred feet from a Dwelling on another property.
Please contact the Zoning Officer with questions related to the information above.
My pet ran away… Who should I contact?
You may contact the Police department to advise us your animal is missing and to check if it was found. (Please recontact us if you locate your animal.) Stray dogs will be held at the Township kennels until they can be transported to the Sanctuary at Haafsville, 901 Nestle Way, Breinigsville, PA 18031 or the owner is located. Per South Whitehall Township Ordinance, there is a penalty assessed in the amount of $50; additionally, the owner is responsible for paying all reasonable expenses that the Township incurs for keeping the animal (including a charge for daily board) prior to release of the dog.  This applies to both licensed and unlicensed dogs.
You may also contact the Sanctuary at Haafsville at 484-788-8062 to check if your animal has been turned in to them.
What can I do about the skunks (or other nuisance animals) in my yard?
Police officers do not dispatch nuisance animals, only those that are visibly sick or injured. Please contact an animal control company for assistance.
Animal Licenses
South Whitehall Township does not license animals. Lehigh County does license dogs. Dog licenses may be purchased at the Lehigh County Government Center (17 South Seventh Street Room 119 Allentown, PA), at one of the designated issuing agents or by mail. The license is valid only for the calendar year. Visit Lehigh County Government Center for more information.
For questions or issues regarding wildlife please visit Pa Game Commission or contact the Pennsylvania Game Commission 2001 Elmerton Avenue Harrisburg, PA 17110-9797 (717) 787-4250.
 
Moving In
What do I need to do?
Please download and submit a Moving Permit. This permit alerts the Township and the Parkland School District to your change of address. Be sure to complete a change of address package with your local post office to ensure that your mail is delivered to the proper address.
Street Lights
What is the procedure for installing a streetlight?
PPL will install a streetlight only if the Township authorizes them to do so as the Township will incur the cost. Therefore, a completed Streetlight Petition Application must be submitted to the Township Board of Commissioners for their consideration. The applicant may attend the Board meeting to discuss the matter. If the Board finds the request plausible, the Township will authorize PPL to install the fixture.
The estimated time frame is 6 to 9 months after authorization. The Township has no control on when the installation will occur after authorization. A petition is not required for streetlight installation in subdivisions under construction as authorization was pre-approved in the subdivision plan approval process. Usually, streetlights are installed in developing subdivisions when 50% of the houses are built on a given street.
What is the procedure for having a streetlight replaced or repaired?
PPL provides the maintenance on all Township street lights. You can report the problem to PPL or we can report it for you. PPL will need to know the pole location and any identification numbers that are tagged on the pole.
Please report all streetlight maintenance requests to the PPL Customer Contact Center at 1-800-342-5775.
Trees
When dealing with the Township, trees are divided into several categories, each of which has its own associated regulations. “Shade Trees” or “Street Trees” refers to trees within the rights-of-way of public streets. These trees are most commonly known as the trees between the curb and the sidewalk along many public streets. Since the right-of-way of any given public street will generally extend beyond the edge of the roadway, it may not be easy to determine, in areas without sidewalks, if a given tree is a “Shade Tree.” Please call the Township if you have a question regarding the location of the right-of-way of a public street. “Parking Lot Trees” refers to those trees in and surrounding commercial parking lots as required by the Zoning Ordinance. “Buffer Strips” refers to trees and vegetation that serve as an attractive sound and light barrier around commercial uses as required by the Zoning Ordinance. Generally speaking, all other trees on private property are considered private property and may only be subject to Township concern should a situation arise regarding visibility along (or access to) a public right-of-way, danger to property, or public safety.
You can download the Shade Tree Permit Application or the larger, more informative Shade Tree Permit Application Packet by clicking on them or choosing them from the forms folder on the left.
Planting and Maintaining Shade Trees
There is a large body of literature available to aid in the selection, installation and maintenance of trees. The Township has created the South Whitehall Township Shade Tree Ordinances, Policy and Guide to help residents understand Township regulations with regard to trees, as well as offer useful information regarding the selection, installation and maintenance of trees. The Township has created a number of smaller, more specific guides for residents to use a well. You can find them in the documents folder the left hand side of this page.
