Important News About Open Burning..(Because of the volume of inquiries, we have decided to leave this on the website.)   Effective February 22, 2012 the Township has officially rescinded its Open Burning Policy and will no longer issue permits. This action is a result of formal notification from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PaDEP) that we are a mandated community under Act 101 and thus any burning is regulated by the state and we cannot supersede its authority. Based on the state law, the only property owners permitted to burn are those considered to be "working farms", defined as the production of agricultural commodities in their unmanufactured state on the premises of the farm operation.  Campfires and ceremonial fires are also permitted. Yard waste is NOT permitted to be burned.  Yard waste is defined as leaves, grass clippings, garden residue, tree trimmings, chipped shrubbery, and other vegetative materials. Because the Township is a mandated community we are responsible for the enforcement of this Act, and will do what is necessary to ensure that the Township and our residents remain in compliance with it.

Plumstead Township is located in the eastern portion of central Bucks County.  It is approximately 25 miles north of the City of Philadelphia and just northeast of Doylestown Borough, the County seat.
