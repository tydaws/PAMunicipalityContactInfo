Miscellaneous Information
Flood Recovery Guide
The Flood Recovery Guide is designed to aide residents in cleaning up from floods.
Pennsylvania State Yellow Dot Program
This was first initiated in Connecticut in 2002; the Yellow Dot Program has given a voice to people in life-threatening situations. This is not only valuable to those in serious accidents; it’s also a vital tool in less serious accidents when victims may have difficulty remembering things.
Special Needs Registry
The Registry is a planning tool to allow individuals with special needs the opportunity to provide information to local and county emergency response agencies, so emergency responders can better plan to serve them in a disaster.
Tip for Residential Heating Oil Tank Owners
Residential heating oil tanks are tanks that store fuel oil to provide space heating on premises where they are located. Home heating oil releases can result from leaks, spills, overfills, or heating system malfunctions. These can cause damage to your home and cause health problems.
