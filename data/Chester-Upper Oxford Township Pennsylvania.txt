Local Tax Return is Due April 18

It's that time of year again. The 2015 local earned income tax return filing deadline is approaching. The due date is extended to Monday April 18 this year because Washington DC is commemorating Emancipation Day on Friday April 15.

Did you know the quickest way to get your refund is to file online? If you live and work in Pennsylvania, you can e-file on our tax administrator's secure website, which is available 24/7 at www.KeystoneCollects.com.
Keystone Collections Group's e-file is the easy, fast and secure way to file your 2015 tax return.  It lets you file your tax return when it is most convenient for you. You will need your W-2, your Social Security Number and any other income documents that may apply (such as a PA-UE or a Schedule C).
Keystone redesigned e-file to make it even faster and more user-friendly.
If you have questions regarding local tax filing, visit Keystone's Frequently Asked Questions or call Keystone's Taxpayer Helpline at 1-888-328-0565 to speak with a local, knowledgeable Taxpayer Service Agent. You can also email your questions 24/7 to Taxpayer Support. Taxpayer Service Agents try to respond to all online inquiries within three business days.
Taxpayers with earned income in 2015 are required to file a Final Tax Return by Monday, April 18.
