We were invited to receive this award at an in-person ceremony Wednesday in Harrisburg. It is an honor to receive this award as it is the first for our local government. “Each year one week is designated by the PA Legislature as “Local Government Week,” honoring the dedication of Pennsylvania’s local officials and encouraging citizens to learn how local government functions and affects each resident and business in the community. During this week, the Governor’s Center for Local Government Services has made a tradition of hosting a Local Government Day celebration,featuring the presentation of the Governor’s Awards for Local Government Excellence to recognize local officials for their successes in undertaking innovative initiatives to improve the quality of life in their communities.” Through updates of our financial system, implementation of our “My City” app, and increasing the visibility of our local events, the City of Saint Marys has enhanced its technology to better serve its residents. We have changed how we do business to provide the most effective and efficient way possible. Both the PA Senate and House of Representatives acknowledged the achievements of our local government with citations from State Senator Cris Dush and State Representative Mike Armanini, who were present during the ceremony.11 Lafayette StreetSt. Marys, PA 15857 P: (814) 781-1718F: (814) 834-1304 Copyright © 2022 by The City of St. Marys PA.
