Effective January 1, 2010: Upper Macungie Township is enforcing the PA 2009 Uniform Construction Codes and that all code questions should be addressed to the code officials only.
Zoning
The purpose and scope of the Township’s Zoning Ordinance has been described elsewhere on this website. In short, those considering making nonresidential improvements of any kind should consult either the Township Zoning Officer or the table of contents of the Township’s Zoning Ordinance to gain insight as to what kinds of issues may arise with the proposal for nonresidential improvements.
Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance
The purpose and scope of the Township’s Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance (SALDO) has been discussed elsewhere on this website. In short, any nonresidential improvement may be subject to full SALDO review by the Board of Supervisors, Township Engineer and/or Solicitor.
Water and Sewer Fees
Any new nonresidential building, any expansion of a nonresidential use or building, or any intensification of a nonresidential use or building, may lead to additional water and sewer service connection charges (regardless of whether there is a physical change to the utility piping proposed). Call Upper Macungie Township at 610-398-4892 for sewer information or Lehigh County Authority at 610-398-8413 for water service information.
Original Applications
Original applications are required.  Documents shall be submitted in accordance with Section 403 of the Pa. UCC with an original application (no copies).  All permit applications shall be complete when submitted or the documents will be deemed not sufficient for review and returned to the applicant.
Applications can be picked up at the Municipal Building, Monday - Friday 7:30 a.m. - 4:00 p.m.
When you submit full sets of building plans, provide three copies of everything.  That enables us to provide copies to our in-house staff and our third-party agencies for simultaneous review.

Purpose of Zoning Review
To assure the appropriate use of land insofar as a variety of subjects are concerned, including but not limited to:

To keep proposed land uses consistent with those permitted by the Zoning Ordinance and Map.
Limiting the intensity of building by assuring the setback of buildings, parking lots, etc., from property lines.
Checking the amount of impervious surface created by building, parking lots, etc., that may affect storm water runoff.
Registering and controlling the expansion of “grandfathered” (called non-conforming) features and activities that do not conform to current regulations.
Temporary events

Note: Printed copies of the Zoning Ordinance are available for $35

Process of Zoning Relief
Those wishing to conduct a new activity or install a new physical feature on a given property within the Township, apply for a zoning permit with a standard application (available at the Township) with all pertinent plans and information. Zoning permits are issued if the activity or structure proposed conforms to the Zoning Ordinance. Otherwise, the applicant is contacted explaining the deficiency(ies). The applicant whose permit is denied has the option of appealing to the Zoning Hearing Board by completing a Zoning Appeal Application. 
Zoning Hearing Board meetings are usually held the 2nd and 4th Wednesday of the month at 6:30 p.m., are open to the public and all township residents are encouraged to attend.  Appeals – with all pertinent information – must be received at the Township approximately four weeks prior to the hearing, in order to meet State advertising requirements.
