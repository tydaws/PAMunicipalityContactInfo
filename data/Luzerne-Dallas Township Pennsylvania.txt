State Route 309 Long Term Road Work
PennDOT has awarded Kriger Construction, Inc. the SR 309 Signal Corridor Safety Improvement Project.

Please plan your travels accordingly.This project will enhance safety measures along the stretch of State Route 309 between Hillside Road and the SR 309/SR 415 split. The project aims to improve intersection safety by linking the 10 signals in the corridor, updating controllers, optimizing timing, replacing mast arms, signal heads and back plates with LED signal heads, and adding new ADA ramps and line striping.
