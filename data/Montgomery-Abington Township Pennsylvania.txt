To All Permit Applicants 


Applicant Information

Please be  advised the Home Improvement Consumer Protection Act (Act 132 of 2008) and the International Building Code mandated by the Department of Labor and Industry of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and adopted by the Township of Abington are in effect.  Contractors who perform home improvements for which the total cash value is $5,000 or more per year are required to register with the Office of Attorney General by July 1. Click here for registration form and details.
Within the regulations there will be more stringent requirements for plans that are submitted for permits, both commercial and residential;
When requested, plans for residential applications must also be prepared by an architect, and include electrical, plumbing, energy and HVAC calculations.  Site plans, accurately drawn and calculated, must also be completed and submitted for review for both commercial and residential applications;
Improperly preparing your application, as noted above, will automatically cause delays in your time schedule for most anticipated work; therefore, ample time should be factored in when preparing your plans. Due to the scope of work to be reviewed, additional time will be required by the Code Department to review the average submittal;
Any application for a building permit that requires access to a highway falling under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation, will not be issued until a Highway Occupancy Permit is issued;
The Township of Abington is now requiring that all commercial projects be reviewed entirely prior to permit submission to the Township.  An entire plan review would consist of Building, Electric, Mechanical, Plumbing, Energy, Fire and Accessibility. Applicants must use a state approved third party agency.
Questions regarding the process can be directed to 267-536-1000 ext. 4.

Change/Remove/Add a Name on a Deed
As provided by Montgomery County Recorder of Deeds, "to change, add or remove a name on your deed a new deed needs to be recorded reflecting the change. Many people think they can come into the office and change the present recorded deed with a form, but that is not the case. Once a deed is recorded it cannot be changed. We recommend you consult a real estate attorney or title company to prepare a new deed.
If a married couple held the property jointly as tenants by entireties and one spouse dies, it is not necessary to remove that spouse’s name from the deed. If/when the survivor sells or mortgages the property, he/she simply explains in the new deed or mortgage that the other spouse is deceased. A special instance due to a particular legal situation could occur where the name should be deleted, therefore, we recommend consulting an attorney or title company for specific advice.
If someone marries, it is not required to change the name on the deed to the married name, but because of a particular legal situation it may be desirable, therefore we again recommend consulting an attorney or title company for specific advice.


Our office cannot recommend a real estate attorney or title company. The following organizations may be able to provide recommendations:

Montgomery County Bar Association Lawyer Referral Service
Pennsylvania Land Title Association
Legal Aid of Southeastern Pennsylvania"

From Montgomery County's Recorder of Deeds web-page "How Do I Change/Add/Remove a Name on a Deed."
Deed Registration

Click here to download the "Affidavit for Display of Street Numbers and Installation of Smoke Detectors and Carbon Monoxide Detectors" form.

To All Permit Applicants 


Applicant Information


Please be  advised the Home Improvement Consumer Protection Act (Act 132 of 2008) and the International Building Code mandated by the Department of Labor and Industry of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and adopted by the Township of Abington are in effect.  Contractors who perform home improvements for which the total cash value is $5,000 or more per year are required to register with the Office of Attorney General by July 1. Click here for registration form and details.
Within the regulations there will be more stringent requirements for plans that are submitted for permits, both commercial and residential;
Applications for commercial work must include plans prepared by an architect and be complete with electrical, plumbing, HVAC and energy calculations;
When requested, plans for residential applications must also be prepared by an architect, and include electrical, plumbing, energy and HVAC calculations.  Site plans, accurately drawn and calculated, must also be completed and submitted for review for both commercial and residential applications;
Improperly preparing your application, as noted above, will automatically cause delays in your time schedule for most anticipated work; therefore, ample time should be factored in when preparing your plans. Due to the scope of work to be reviewed, additional time will be required by the Code Department to review the average submittal;
Any application for a building permit that requires access to a highway falling under the jurisdiction of the Department of Transportation, will not be issued until a Highway Occupancy Permit is issued;
The Township of Abington is now requiring that all commercial projects be reviewed entirely prior to permit submission to the Township.  An entire plan review would consist of Building, Electric, Mechanical, Plumbing, Energy, Fire and Accessibility. Applicants must use a state approved third party agency.
Questions regarding the process can be directed to 267-536-1000 ext. 4.

Severe weather can be dangerous and unpredictable. Understand the potential impact of severe weather and be prepared to respond when it occurs. The best protection from severe storms is a well-rehearsed plan. Be sure your family knows what to do when threatening weather approaches.

Severe Weather Watch: Severe weather is possible or expected


Severe Weather Warning: Severe weather is imminent or already occurring in your community.

Emergency Phone Numbers

Dial 9-1-1 For POLICE, FIRE or MEDICAL EMERGENCY
IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR DIALING 9-1-1 FROM A CELLULAR PHONE

Did you know that the majority of 9-1-1 calls are made with a cell phone?
Did you also know that if you dial 9-1-1 from a cell phone then your emergency call could be routed to a different county's 9-1-1 center, such as Philadelphia, depending on your location and your cell phone carrier?
Calls to 9-1-1 get routed to the 9-1-1 call center in the county where the cell tower that your call originates is physically located.
If you dial 9-1-1 from a cell phone in Abington, always start the conversation with "I am in Abington Township, Montgomery County" so that the call taker can transfer you to the Montgomery County 9-1-1 Center if need be.

Family Disaster Planning 










The Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) pamphlet "Your Family Disaster Plan," helps  families develop a disaster plan in the event of emergency. 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Flash Flood Information
Flash flooding can occur within a few minutes or after hours of excessive rainfall. Most flash flooding is caused by slow-moving thunderstorms; thunderstorms repeatedly moving over the same area. 
Flash floods can roll boulders, tear out trees, and destroy buildings, roads, and bridges. Streets can become rivers. Even six inches of fast-moving water can knock you off your feet. A depth of 2 feet can float a car!
NEVER try to walk, swim or drive through swift water. Nearly half of all flood related fatalities are auto related; people trapped in their cars by rising water, or trying to drive through swift moving water.
If you come upon flood waters, STOP, TURN AROUND, and go another way. Be on the lookout for rapidly rising water at highway dips, bridges, and low areas.
You may not always have adequate warning that these dangerous flash floods are coming. If you live in a flood prone area, plan ahead. Identify where you can go if you need to evacuate. Plan a safe route away from low-lying areas. Most homeowner's insurance policies do not cover flooding. Check with your insurance agent to see how to get federally sponsored flood insurance.
The rule for being safe in a flooding situation is simple: Head for higher ground and stay away from flood waters.
 

Power Outages 
To report a power outage to PECO:

Call the outage hotline at 1-800-841-4141
Go to the PECO Website, Report a Power Outage Page

To report a downed power line to PECO:

Downed Power Lines should be treated as an EMERGENCY and reported to PECO immediately 

Call PECO's emergency line at 1-800-841-4141 to report a downed power line

Receive emergency, community, weather and crime notifications

Please take a minute to register yourself and family members for this important service at: www.readymontco.org.
Visit our Ready Montco webpage for more information. 
Spring Flooding Tips
