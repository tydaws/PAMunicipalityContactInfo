About Our Township


Introduction to Sandycreek Township
Sandycreek Township is one of Pennsylvania’s 2,561 self-governing municipalities. The small size of local governments in Pennsylvania is a part of a unique heritage of making local government small enough to maximize the opportunities of citizens to participate in decisions. The Township is governed by a board of three supervisors, who are elected on staggered terms by the citizens across the entire community (At-large election).
Community History 
Sandycreek Township was named in 1834. An early Venango County history noted that the first settler was Patrick Manson, a native of Ireland, who found a home in the Township in 1797. Through-out the 19th century, the Township name was frequently spelled as “Sandy Creek.”
