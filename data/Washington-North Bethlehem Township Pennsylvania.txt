North Bethlehem Township












North Bethlehem Township
Washington County, Pennsylvania
Our township is registered as a second class township. Although not second class to those of us who live here. Pennsylvania has two classes of townships and all are second class except where first class status has been approved by the voter’s. We would need 300 people per square mile living in the township to be first class. We are just fine with our historic village, cows and trees. Oh, and the view from here is incredible.
