               Short-Term Rental Use and Regulations in Effect
Zoning and Short-Term Rental Ordinance Amendments 2023-100 and 2023-101 adopted 1/23/2023
All short-term rentals, also known as vacation rentals, are regulated with Ordinance 2018-100. On January 23, 2023, Jackson Township Board of Supervisors adopted Ordinance 2023-100 and Ordinance 2023-101. This amends Ordinance 2018-100.  With the adoption of Ordinances 2023-100 and 2023-101, the use of a home as a short term rental in the Residential (R1) zoning district is now prohibited. Existing permitted properties in this zoning district, may continue to operate as nonconforming (as stated within the Ordinance). Please click on the "Short Term Rental " tab to view the ordinances.
A permit must be obtained prior to the use of any home as a short term rental. Permit applications and guidance can be found on the main menu, Short-Term Rental Page. Applications are processed in order of receipt. Applications will not be processed or reviewed without a complete application form and application fee payment. 
Please email rmiller@jacksontwp-pa.gov with any questions.
