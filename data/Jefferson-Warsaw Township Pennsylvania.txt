History


Warsaw, the fifteenth township, was formed from Pine Creek, and was
  organized in 1842. It was named for a city of Poland. Warsaw is one of the
  largest townships in the county, and is bounded on the north by Polk and
  Heath; on the east by Snyder and Washington; on the south by Washington and
  Pine Creek, and on the west by Eldred.
Early Settlers -- The first settlers in what is now Warsaw township were
  John and Jacob Vasbinder, who came from Mifflin county about the year 1800.
  Jacob Vasbinder first cleared the farm adjoining the farm of James Harris, on
  the east in Pine Creek township, which is now owned by George Vasbinder and
  Benjamin McClelland. He lived on this place until 1841, when he moved to the
  farm now owned by his son, Jacob, where he died in 1848, being at that time
  seventy-two years of age. His wife died at the age of eighty-six. Jacob
  Vasbinder had eight children, four of whom are living. His sons, George and
  T.Miles, reside in East Warsaw.
