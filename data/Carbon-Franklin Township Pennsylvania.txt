Stormwater Information





 



Christina Watersheds Municipal Partnership is a group of municipal and non-profit partners focused on developing strategies to address stormwater pollution in the Brandywine-Christina watersheds of Chester County.  On this website, you will find information on Public Resources, Partner Resources, Meetings & Workshops, and Learn How to Report Emergency Environmental Issues and Complaints.  Click here for a host of other interesting information to help protect our environment.  White Clay Creek National Wild & Scenic RiverCatch the Rain Rebate ProgramStormwater washing off land is the largest source of pollution to the White Clay Creek. Almost all of the rain falling on roofs, driveways, roads, parking lots, mowed lawns, and patios ends up as stormwater runoff.In contrast, rain falling on forests and meadows gradually soaks into the sponge-like soils; pollutants are filtered out, groundwater is replenished, and stream water swings between flood and drought levels are evened out, preserving more constant stream flows and protecting aquatic life.Green Stormwater Infrastructure (GSI) practices can help capture, detain, and infiltrate rain, mimicking natural ecosystems. GSI systems are proven to simulate natural soil filtering and reduce stormwater volumes and speeds.Your green lawn is not so green; in fact, mowed lawns shed almost as much rain (~90%) as paved surfaces (100%)! Smaller lawns also cut down on mowing and fertilizer/pesticide applications.Well managed GSI projects also enhance community beauty, increase property values (5% or more), and provide vital habitat for birds and pollinators.The Catch the Rain invites White Clay watershed homeowners to learn more about green stormwater projects through on site property visits. During your site visit we will explain simple practices you can undertake to improve water quality in your neighborhood and explain how you can apply for rebates to install these Green Stormwater Infrastructure practices including:rain barrels,rain gardens,pervious paving retrofits or removal of existing paving,conservation landscape plantings,and canopy tree plantings.WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT CATCH THE RAIN?Learn how the Catch the Rain Program works. (View/download how to become a White Clay Creek-wise homeowner)See what type of rebate you could qualify for: (View/download the Catch the Rain Rebate Table)Read our brochure: (View/download the Catch the Rain Program Brochure) Click here to start your application.If you are interested in attending an upcoming workshop please contact Shane Morgan at mpc@whiteclay.org with the subject heading Catch the Rain and please include your name, address, and contact information in the body of the email. Stormwater InformationWhat is Stormwater and Why is it a Problem? Stormwater is rainfall that runs off of roofs, driveways, lawns, roads, parking lots, sidewalks, farm fields, and other surfaces created or disturbed by manmade activities. This runoff picks up pollutants (such as dirt, oil, litter, pesticides, fertilizer, etc.) as it flows across these surfaces, and eventually enters local streams. While Rainfall is Natural, Stormwater is Man-MadeLarge volumes of stormwater overwhelm, erode and pollute local streams, and flood low lying areas. To lessen these destructive stormwater impacts and help ensure any existing problems do not worsen, municipalities across Chester County have adopted new stormwater management ordinance standards. These new standards are a key tool in reducing these stormwater impacts, safeguarding properties from flooding and erosion, and protecting streams and local water quality. Stormwater Management OrdinanceAs of December 18th, 2013, any previous version of Chapter 19 of the Franklin Township Code of Ordinances is hereby repealed in its entirety. This Chapter has been replaced with a new version entitled "Chapter 19: Stormwater Management", which amends certain provisions pertaining to stormwater within the Franklin Township Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance and Zoning Ordinance. Chapter 19 of the Franklin Township Code of Ordinances, amended and enacted on 12/18/2013Please Do Not Rake Your Leaves and Yard Waste Into the Street! Although you may see a street sweeper cleaning the streets around the Township, the Township does not pick up grass clippings and leaves for residents. It is the responsibility of each individual homeowner to dispose of their own grass clippings and leaves and not put them in the street or on top of stormwater inlets. Click here for more information and education regarding Township resident's responsibilities for their grass clippings and leaves.Rain Barrels Benefit the EnvironmentRain barrels benefit the environment by:Decreasing the amount of stormwater runoff, thus helping to keep our creeks cleanProviding an alternative water source during periods of dry weatherHelping to maintain a healthy biotic community in the soil, by reducing the need to water plants with chlorine-treated waterReducing the demand for treated water

Recycling Information





 



Recycling Bin Update - Designated - Clean Materials OnlyPublic Help is Needed!This is a reminder that only clean and designated materials should be put into the Franklin Township recycling bins.   Especially at this time of year when the bins fill up quickly from holiday packaging.  “When in doubt, throw it out.”An audit of the bins on December 29 showed many issues that will result in recyclables being redirected to the trash, and possibly resulting in sorted recyclables being rejected for shipment to an end consumer.The images below from December 29 show the problems.  Here are some reminders:Please remember to rinse containers completely, and if that’s not practical throw them into the trash. Discard lids unless specifically marked for recycling.Discard lids from spray bottles (the lid is probably made of several different non-recyclable materials.) Remove all contents from medicine bottles including cotton. Do not put Styrofoam into the recycling bins. Do not recycle cardboard with food residue on it. Remember to flatten boxes.The bins are managed by Southeastern Chester County Refuse Authority (SECCRA).  If you are not sure what to put in the bins, please review the instructions on SECCRA’s website or see the placard farther below.Thanks for your cooperation!  Jack Nystrom - Franklin Township Recycling CoordinatorTrash or Recycle?With technological advances, recycling has come a long way and we are recycling more items than ever before. If you are doing it correctly, you just might have more recycling than trash. When done correctly, recyclables have value but when done incorrectly they are nothing but trash. To know what to do, view a 2 1/2 minute video free of charge at any time on your computer. The video was originally created for Chester County government buildings but applies to all households, businesses and institutions in Chester County because we all collect the same items. Click here for our "Single Stream Recycling Video". It is that simple. For more information call (610) 273-3771 ext. 22. Electronics Recycling Current Pennsylvania law bans certain types of electronics (laptops, desktops, monitors, televisions, et al.) from being placed in a landfill with municipal waste. Instead, all such electronics must be recycled in an approved recycling facility.Municipal trash haulers are banned from mixing these electronic devices with any trash going to a landfill.This law requires consumers of these electronic devices to arranging for or take their electronics to an approved electronics collection location. Some retailers may also offer no-cost collection opportunities.Knowing that electronics recycling can be inconvenient and costly, consumers may also bring electronics to SECCRA and dispose of them in the designated electronics collection area, at no charge. Please note that this is only for individuals that reside in our service area. If you come to SECCRA, please notify the attendant at the "drive-thru window" in our scale house that you have electronics. You will be asked if you are bringing electronics as an individual or if you are bringing electronics on behalf of a business or other entity. We are not permitted to take electronics from non-individual sources. Therefore, if you are not an individual bringing electronics, you will be turned away.In addition, when you arrive and speak to our attendant, you will be asked if you have other materials besides electronics to dispose. If they are mixed with other trash, we will charge you for the weight of materials you brought to us for disposal. If electronics are the only thing you bring to us, then there will be no charge. Based on our security video and the weight of the load you bring us, we may decide to charge you for disposal if our staff determines that the amount of electronics you brought to us may indicate that they might be from a source other than a consumer.Township Recycling BinsFranklin Township has recycling bins on the Township property located just behind the Kemblesville Post Office. The bins accept newspaper, cardboard and recyclables 1-7. The Township Recycling Coordinator, Jack Nystrom, is responsible for submitting the yearly Township Recycling Performance Grant.

Recycling Bin Update - Designated - Clean Materials OnlyPublic Help is Needed!This is a reminder that only clean and designated materials should be put into the Franklin Township recycling bins.   Especially at this time of year when the bins fill up quickly from holiday packaging.  “When in doubt, throw it out.”An audit of the bins on December 29 showed many issues that will result in recyclables being redirected to the trash, and possibly resulting in sorted recyclables being rejected for shipment to an end consumer.The images below from December 29 show the problems.  Here are some reminders:Please remember to rinse containers completely, and if that’s not practical throw them into the trash. Discard lids unless specifically marked for recycling.Discard lids from spray bottles (the lid is probably made of several different non-recyclable materials.) Remove all contents from medicine bottles including cotton. Do not put Styrofoam into the recycling bins. Do not recycle cardboard with food residue on it. Remember to flatten boxes.The bins are managed by Southeastern Chester County Refuse Authority (SECCRA).  If you are not sure what to put in the bins, please review the instructions on SECCRA’s website or see the placard farther below.Thanks for your cooperation!  Jack Nystrom - Franklin Township Recycling CoordinatorTrash or Recycle?With technological advances, recycling has come a long way and we are recycling more items than ever before. If you are doing it correctly, you just might have more recycling than trash. When done correctly, recyclables have value but when done incorrectly they are nothing but trash. To know what to do, view a 2 1/2 minute video free of charge at any time on your computer. The video was originally created for Chester County government buildings but applies to all households, businesses and institutions in Chester County because we all collect the same items. Click here for our "Single Stream Recycling Video". It is that simple. For more information call (610) 273-3771 ext. 22. Electronics Recycling Current Pennsylvania law bans certain types of electronics (laptops, desktops, monitors, televisions, et al.) from being placed in a landfill with municipal waste. Instead, all such electronics must be recycled in an approved recycling facility.Municipal trash haulers are banned from mixing these electronic devices with any trash going to a landfill.This law requires consumers of these electronic devices to arranging for or take their electronics to an approved electronics collection location. Some retailers may also offer no-cost collection opportunities.Knowing that electronics recycling can be inconvenient and costly, consumers may also bring electronics to SECCRA and dispose of them in the designated electronics collection area, at no charge. Please note that this is only for individuals that reside in our service area. If you come to SECCRA, please notify the attendant at the "drive-thru window" in our scale house that you have electronics. You will be asked if you are bringing electronics as an individual or if you are bringing electronics on behalf of a business or other entity. We are not permitted to take electronics from non-individual sources. Therefore, if you are not an individual bringing electronics, you will be turned away.In addition, when you arrive and speak to our attendant, you will be asked if you have other materials besides electronics to dispose. If they are mixed with other trash, we will charge you for the weight of materials you brought to us for disposal. If electronics are the only thing you bring to us, then there will be no charge. Based on our security video and the weight of the load you bring us, we may decide to charge you for disposal if our staff determines that the amount of electronics you brought to us may indicate that they might be from a source other than a consumer.Township Recycling BinsFranklin Township has recycling bins on the Township property located just behind the Kemblesville Post Office. The bins accept newspaper, cardboard and recyclables 1-7. The Township Recycling Coordinator, Jack Nystrom, is responsible for submitting the yearly Township Recycling Performance Grant.
