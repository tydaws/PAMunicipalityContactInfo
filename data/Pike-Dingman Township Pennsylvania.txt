Help Stop the Spotted Lanternfly !
It's not just a good idea ---it's the law!
 


The Spotted Lanternfly is an invasive insect 
native to China and Southeast Asia.  It was accidently introduced into 
Bucks County Pennsylvania and is spreading rapidly.  It destroys fruit 
trees, hardwood trees, garden plants and vegetables, and has no known predators.  
It is estimated that if introduced throughout the Commonwealth, the economic 
damage to Pennsylvania alone will exceed 18 billion dollars.
The Spotted Lanternfly tends to spread by 
hitching a ride on cars or trucks (including their contents) that are driving through an 
infested area.  The adults in particular are very adept to holding on to a 
vehicle when it is traveling at high speed.
How can you help prevent the spread of the 
Spotted Lanternfly.
1.  Learn how to
identify 
the Lanternfly in its various life stages.
2.  Learn which counties are considered part 
of the Spotted Lanternfly 
Quarantine Zones.
3.  Inspect your vehicle before leaving a 
quarantine zone.
4.  Inspect your vehicle after arriving at 
your destination (or when taking a break outside of the quarantine zone.
5.  Properly kill any Lanternflies found on 
your vehicle or its contents.
6.  Properly destroy any Lanternfly egg 
masses you might find.
7.  Report any sightings of Lanternflies or 
their egg masses that you find outside the Quarantine Zone.
8.  Inspect any goods that may be shipped to 
you to ensure that there are no Lanternflies or egg masses on them. 

IF YOU DRIVE A COMMERCIAL VEHICLE OR ONE USED IN 
BUSINESS INCLUDING NON-PROFITS AND CHARITIES AND WILL BE ENTERING THE LANTERNFLY 
QUARENTINE ZONE, YOU MUST FIRST RECEIVE A 
PERMIT AND KEEP AN INSPECTION LOG.  FAILURE TO DO SO MAY SUBJECT YOU TO 
FINE OF $ 300 AND A CIVIL PENALTY OF UP TO $ 20,000.
It is also recommended that all residents take 
the free on-line training.  The quarantine zone, as of this writing, starts 
just below Bushkill.  Nearby places like Stroudsburg and Marshalls Creek 
lie within the quarantine zone.
Penn State and other major universities along 
with federal and state governments are researching controls to prevent the 
Spotted Lanternfly from destroying America.  Your cooperation in preventing 
its spread will help buy time to develop the control.
