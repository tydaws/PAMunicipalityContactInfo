Stormwater Management and MS4

Stormwater 101
Stormwater runoff is rainfall that flows over the ground surface and is created when rain falls on roads, driveways, parking lots, rooftops and other impervious surfaces. Runoff eventually enters into a storm system and then discharges into a stream or river. Stormwater runoff in Ohio Township discharges into the Ohio River.
As stormwater runoff flows over the ground, it picks up many pollutants such as sediment, fertilizers, pesticides, oil, trash, and debris which also discharge into local waterways. According to the Center for Watershed Protection, stormwater runoff is considered the number one cause of stream impairment in urban areas.

Ohio Township Stormwater Management Program
Pursuant to federal and state regulations, Ohio Township has implemented a Stormwater Management Program in order to reduce and eliminate polluted runoff from entering local waterways.
This is done by managing the Township’s Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System, or MS4. The Township’s MS4 is essentially the storm system which is owned and managed by Ohio Township (i.e. township-owned roads and property). This may include anything that carries stormwater such as catch basins, pipes, ditches, and swales.
Click here to view Ohio Township’s written Stormwater Management Program and what is being done to reduce stormwater pollution. In addition to reducing pollution, the stormwater management program also aids in preventing flooding, protecting drinking water, enhancing infrastructure, and preventing erosion and sedimentation issues.
  
 







Report Illicit Discharge
An illicit discharge is defined as any discharge to the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) that is not entirely composed of storm water. This includes, but is not limited to, yard waste, pet waste, litter, debris, paint, motor oil, car wash detergents, and illegal sanitary connections. These non-stormwater discharges enter our local waterways untreated. Procedures to detect and eliminate illicit discharges have been implemented into the Township's Stormwater Management Program. Click here to report an illicit discharge.

What You Can Do
Remember that anything entering the storm system eventually discharges into the Ohio River untreated. Anything that discharges into a stream or river that isn’t entirely comprised of stormwater is considered an illicit discharge. Please be cautious and keep the following things in mind to prevent stormwater pollution:


DON’T DUMP! Don’t dump used motor oil, paint, and other household hazardous waste into the storm system. Doing so pollutes waterways and harms aquatic life. View Ohio Township’s Trash, Recycling, and Yard Waste Handbook for more information on how to properly dispose of Household Hazardous Waste through Waste Management.


DON’T LITTER! Always dispose of trash and other debris in the proper receptacles. Most debris that on roadways eventually discharges into streams and rivers.


SCOOP THE POOP! Pet waste can easily enter the storm system and carry harmful bacteria if not disposed of properly.


FERTILIZE SMART! When using fertilizers and pesticides, follow the label for use and storage methods. Excess fertilizer and pesticides won’t improve grass growth and can run off into the street and enter the storm system. You can also test your soil to save money in the long run by avoiding over-application and determine exactly what a lawn needs to look sharp. Test kits are relatively inexpensive and are available at local hardware stores, garden centers, or any county Penn State Extension office.


SWEEP UP! Be sure to sweep grass clippings off the street and driveway and properly dispose of yard waste in the fall during leaf clean-up.


REPORT ILLICIT DISCHARGES! Anything that enters a stream or storm system that isn’t entirely stormwater is considered an illicit discharge. Click the link under “Report Illicit Discharge” if you suspect that you have detected an illicit discharge in your area.

Municipal Building

Welcome to Ohio Township
Ohio Township was the third township to be formed in Allegheny County in September, 1803. We are located nine (9) miles northwest of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. During the past 200 years, Ohio Township has quietly made the transition from an agricultural area to a mix of suburban residential developments and commercial businesses.







Calendar
All meetings are open to the public, and held at the Ohio Township Municipal Building located at 1719 Roosevelt Road, Pittsburgh, PA  15237 unless otherwise indicated.
