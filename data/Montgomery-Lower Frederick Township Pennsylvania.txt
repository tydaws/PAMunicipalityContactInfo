Fulmer/Riverside Sewer Extension Project


Contractor for the Sewer Extension Project: Doli Construction Corporation
Timeline for the project:  Doli is working to procure the raw material for this project and expects to begin construction in the early fall of 2022.
Email List for Updates: If you would like to receive updates on this project, please email manager@lowerfrederick.org and ask to placed on the email list for the Fulmer/Riverside Sewer Extension Project.

UPDATE 4-18-2023 Project Schedule and Paving
At Mid-April, Doli Construction is working on building the pump station just off Riverside Avenue.  Meanwhile, road restoration is planned for the coming months.  Road paving will be performed after the pump station work is substantially complete.
What is the white paint on my driveway?
The paving of Fulmer and Riverside may raise the road surface (± 2 inches) in many locations.  The white paint marks the possible extent of “transition pavement” to transition from your existing driveway to the newly paved street.  The mark was placed during quantity estimation with temporary marking paint.  It will wash or wear away in weeks.
Will the road be widened?
Generally, no.  Fulmer and Riverside may gain inches on one side or the other during restoration, but no formal road widening is planned, no additional trees or shrubs are scheduled for removal.  The exception is at the intersection of Riverside and Bavington, where limited widening is planned to accommodate traffic that will build and service the new pump station.
When will the roads be re-paved?
The paving date is not yet determined, but it will not begin before mid-June.  July paving is more likely, and we will continue to keep you informed.
When can sewer connections begin?
We don’t have a firm answer yet, but if all continues according to plan the pump station start-up and testing would begin at the end of June or early July.  This is a construction project, so bad weather, subcontractor schedules, or other unforeseen circumstances may change this timeline.
Connecting to the Sewer
Residents will be notified by mail when the system is ready to accept new connections.  Homes within 150 feet of the new sewer main will be required to connect to the sewer system.  Plumbing from homes to roadside cleanouts must be installed by a licensed plumber. If you do not have a plumber, a list of plumbers you might contact is on the Township website at  https://lowerfrederick.org/?page_id=9881 .(Scroll down the web page).
If your plumber advises that you need a grinder pump to connect, a grinder pump design will be necessary.  Please contact the Township office for further guidance on the process for grinder pump design and approval at 610-287-8857 or staff@lowerfrederick.org.
Thank you for your patience as we look forward to the successful completion of this project!
UPDATE 4-07-2023 Sewer work on Riverside
As we reach the beginning of April, Doli Construction is installing sewer main on Riverside Avenue.   Most of the sewer service laterals on Fulmer Road have been installed, and the off-road sewer main and laterals in the area known as Avenue B have been installed.
The contractor has initiated work to construct the pump station at the low point on Riverside Avenue, which will continue throughout the month of April.
Eager residents have asked when they can connect, but we still have work to be done before the system can accept wastewater.

The contractor is currently installing sewer main and manholes.
The service laterals out to each property are being installed. A cleanout is installed at the end of each lateral, which is where your plumber will connect your plumbing to the new collection system.
The Pump Station and the force main must still be constructed.

UPDATE 3-15-2023 Sewer work on Riverside next
In the middle of March, 2023, Doli Construction continues with building the sewer main that will serve your community.  The sewer main and manholes are installed on Fulmer Road and on “B Avenue”, a right-of-way on a private drive.  Installation of sewer service laterals on Fulmer Road continues.  Sewer main and manhole installation on Riverside Avenue will continue this month.  The contractor has initiated work to construct the pump station at the low point on Riverside Avenue.

Update 1-06-2023:  Sewer Work continues in the New Year
As we begin the new year, Doli Construction continues with sewer main construction. 
Eager residents have asked when they can connect, but we still have a distance to go before the system can accept wastewater.

The contractor is currently installing sewer main and manholes.
The service laterals out to each property must be installed. When complete, a cleanout will be installed at the end of each lateral, which is where your plumber will be able to connect.  Cleanout locations are marked by a stake, and if you wish your lateral to be set in a different location, please reach out to have the location adjusted.
The Pump Station must be constructed.

All this will take months.  Timing will depend on weather conditions, how much rock the contractor encounters, and many other factors.  It is likely that the project will not be ready for any connections until well into the Spring of 2023.
Survey Stakes:
Stakes identify the proposed location of the sewer lateral cleanouts. We ask that you do not relocate or remove these stakes.
It is important that you contact your plumbing contractor to assess if the proposed lateral stub location is suitable for your home or if there is a more desirable location on your property for the lateral stub to be placed. For example, another location may work better with where the plumbing currently leaves your home or may reduce impacts from excavation to existing landscaping, driveways, or natural features.   DO NOT MOVE THE SURVEY STAKE!
If you do not have a plumber, a list of plumbers you might contact (is on the Township website)
(is provided further down on this page).
If the proposed lateral stub location needs to be relocated to best serve your property, please contact Jamie Sundermier at Value Engineering Inc.  Jamie can meet with you or your plumber at your property to place an additional stake identifying your preferred location.
Thank you for working with us to toward a successful project!

Update 11-17-2022:  Sewer Work underway on Fulmer Road
Sewer construction contractor DOLI Construction has started installation of sewer pipes and manholes in Fulmer Road. 
Property owners with house numbers 17 through 113 Fulmer Road and 240 through 264 Fulmer Road can expect a letter from the Township in coming days regarding sewer lateral location. The Township will have a stake placed along the front of each property by a surveyor. The stakes will identify the proposed design location of the sewer lateral stubs. We ask that you do not relocate or remove these stakes.
We recognize that a different location may work better based upon where the plumbing currently leaves your home, or may reduce impacts from excavation to existing landscaping, driveways, or natural features.   DO NOT MOVE THE SURVEY STAKE!  The letter will describe how to contact the Township about setting a stake for your preferred location. 
Other property owners in the project area will receive letters from the Township when work is scheduled in the vicinity of their properties.  Thank you for working with us to make this a successful project!

Update 11-09-2022:  Sewer Work in Fulmer Road to Begin
The projected start date is Wednesday November 16, 2022.  DOLI Construction plans to begin installation of sewer pipes and manholes in Fulmer Road.  Work will begin at the intersection of Fulmer Road and Riverside Avenue, proceeding northwest along Fulmer Road.  There will be some manpower onsite Tuesday November 15, 2022 to begin staging.
Property owners with house numbers 204 Fulmer Road through 239 Fulmer Road have been notified as construction will begin in that area.  Every effort will be made to maintain access for property owners throughout the project.
Other property owners in the project area will receive letters from the Township when work is scheduled in the vicinity of their properties.  Thank you for working with us to make this a successful project!

Update 10-14-2022:  Sewer Work on Fulmer Road to begin near the end of October:  Click HERE  for more information.

Plumbers and Contractors That Can Connect Homes To Sewer (in no particular order):
Updated 2023.4.07


The sewer main is an 8-inch diameter pipe in the street.  A 6-inch diameter  line extends from the sewer main to the edge of the road right-of-way.  Your plumber installs a 4-inh diameter line from your home out toward the road and connects to this pipe along the road.
Items to Discuss with your Plumber and Contractor
Have your plumber contact the Township.  We will provide them with the sewer plans that detail the new line in front of your property.

Where to connect along frontage?

The plans detail a location along the front of your property for the Township Contractor to place your connection.  This can be adjusted.  Talk with your plumber about the ideal location for connection, and if adjustment should be made.


Preferred depth to connect.

The sewer line may be 10 feet deep in front of your property, but you need less depth to service your home.  We can work with your plumber on depth so he does not need to do excess digging, possible reducing your cost.


Service to the basement level.

Your plumber can work with you to evaluate if the house basement can be served by a gravity flow connection, or if other options need to be considered.


Price should include pumping out existing septic tank(s).

The existing septic tank or tanks must be pumped clean.  You should confirm if your plumber will pump out the tank, or if you must directly contract with a septic tank service.


Price should include proper abandonment of existing septic tank(s).

Both state and local laws require proper abandonment of existing tanks.  After it is pumped clean, the bottom must be broken and the tank filled with aggregate (stone).


Price should include restoration of lawn and/or driveway area that are disturbed by the plumbers work.
