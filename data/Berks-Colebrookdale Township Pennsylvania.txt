TOWNSHIP SPECIAL ANNOUCEMENTS

Township Roadwork will begin on Wednesday, May 3rd, 2023, weather permitting, on Unger Ln and Weisstown Rd. Please be patient as there may be delays in this area of the Township.Effective this morning, the Berks County Board of Commissioners has rescinded the countywide burn ban. This action was taken under recommendation of the PA DCNR District Forester who advised that it was his opinion that conditions in the last few days and those forecast over the next week support that action. The County Commissioners ask that all residents and businesses that are in the practice of outdoor burning continue to practice caution to ensure fires are manageable and contained.
The construction of the new traffic light at the intersection of Montgomery Ave/N Reading Ave/Henry Ave will begin on Tuesday, September 6th, 2022. Please plan accordingly.

Colebrookdale Township is mandated by the PaDEP to adopt Ordinances and Resolutions regulating recycling within the Township.  The Township regulations for Commercial, Industrial and Residential recycling can be found in the ordinance recycling section. 
Township has signed an agreement with Hopewell Excavating at 172 Fancy Hill Road to have a location for all residents to drop-off their YARD WASTE.  Items acceptable for drop-off include BRANCHES, WOOD CHIPS, TYPICAL YARD WASTE, SMALL STUMPS (no dirt allowed), CLEAN LUMBER. Please follow the link above for more information. Please note the following items are NOT acceptable for drop-off grass clippings, dirt, rocks, soil, edging, painted wood, old mulch and pressure treated wood.
The Berks County Solid Waste Authority has additional information on where to recycling hazardous waste, electronics and tires as well as many ideas and links to informational sites concerning the benefits and results of recycling in your community.
