Building PermitsRandolph Township Building Permit Instructions:

Mechanical Permits (roof, furnace, window replacement, etc) contact Inspectron directly and they will issue you the permit.

Building Permits  (decks, pools, additions, new construction, anything that the PC needs to review ordinance and setbacks for)
1)  needs to be sent to the Randolph Township Clerk.  Electronic versions via email are preferred.  
2)  Once the Clerk receives the permit and required documentation, it will be distributed to the PC and Inspectron for review.  See PC meeting schedule above
3)  After recommendation from the PC and Inspectron, the Board will make a motion on Permit approval.  See Board schedule above.

BE ADVISED we are a small township.  The PC and  Board meet once a month.  Timing of a building permit is key and if a late addition to the meeting agenda cannot be made, permits have been known to take over 45 days.  Remember that the Clerk must be given the permit and ALL documentation (plans, setbacks, application, etc) before it can be reviewed at the PC meeting which happens once a month.
