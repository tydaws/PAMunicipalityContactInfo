Garbage & Recycling Information






The following items are recyclable: ALL papers (newsprint/phone books/magazines/corrugated, etc.), Glass (beverage and food containers only), Plastics #1 – #7 (Food, beverage, shampoo bottles, etc.), Tin, and Aluminum (food and beverage containers). THESE ITEMS CAN ALL BE PLACED IN YOUR NEW 65 GALLON GREEN AND YELLOW RECYCLING BIN. Do not forget to place the container with the lid opening towards the street with a minimum of three feet between each container and/or other objects. Also, there is NO need to put your container out each week if it is only partially full. You may wait until the container is full and then put it out for collection.
Yard waste, including leaves, garden residue, shrubbery, limbs, twigs, brush, tree trimmings and similar material, but not grass clippings, will be collected once each month from March through December. Residents must call in to the Township Office prior to collection to request this service. Further information on collection dates and the call-in phone number are provided in each quarterly Newsletter.
Following is a reminder of items that WILL NOT be picked up during regular trash collection:

Paving materials, stones, rocks, sand, dirt, broken concrete, automobile parts including tires, lead-acid batteries, sod, paints and stains, flammable liquids, 55 gallon metal drums, metal grease drums, pianos, spas, water softeners that have not been emptied of salt, liquids or other chemicals, hot tubs, large screen televisions, furnaces, garage door openers and concrete wash tubs.
Refuse caused by other than minor repairs, alterations, remodeling, demolition and/or construction of buildings and other structures
Bushes, shrubs or other vegetation with earth or soil attached to the root system
Tree trunks, parts of tree trunks or tree trunks that have been cut into smaller pieces
Brush, parts of brush or brush that has been cut into smaller pieces

Residents are reminded that trash must be placed at the curb prior to 6:00 am on Wednesdays (unless collection is delayed due to a holiday). Thank you in advance for your cooperation!!
Over 27,000 tons of usable building material goes to Allegheny County landfills each year. You can play a part in reducing that amount by donating to Construction Junction. Construction Junction, a non-profit retail store where used and surplus building materials, including usable paint, lumber, cabinets and ceramic or vinyl floor tiles, are collected and resold to consumers is located at 214 North Lexington Street in Point Breeze. For more information call 412-243-5025 or visit their website.
Allegheny County Health Department has a comprehensive list of recycling facilities on website.
