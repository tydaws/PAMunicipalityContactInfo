 Welcome to Fairfield Township!
When Westmoreland County was organized, Fairfield was made one of the Townships by the Court at Hannastown, April   6, 1773. The northern section  of the Township is bounded on the east by Laurel Hill and on the west by  Chestnut Ridge, rather hilly and rocky.   In the central section of the Township there are  some fertile farms and fine streams.  And  the southern part of the Township is under laid with a seam of coal.

              Currently Fairfield Township provides service to approximately 63  miles of road.  We are a quiet community  with strong family ties!
