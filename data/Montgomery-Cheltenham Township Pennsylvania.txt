 Stormwater Management Fee Ordinance passed at the December 15, 2021 Board of Commissioners Meeting
Stormwater Fee Rate Structure Report, January 3, 2022
Resolution Establishing an Enterprise Fund for Stormwater Management Fees

At its April 2020 legislative meeting, the Board of Commissioners awarded a professional services contract to Arcadis, a design and consulting firm based from Philadelphia, to conduct a stormwater impact fee feasibility study and help implement the fee if one is determined feasible.

Since then, a Stormwater Advisory Committee (SAC) consisting of residential, commercial and institutional property owners and Township officials has been working with the selected consultant to guide the feasibility study process. The consultant has been meeting with various stakeholders and host several public meetings throughout the process.
Stormwater impact fees are being implemented in communities across the country to help finance projects that will meet increasing state and federal regulations placed upon communities to manage stormwater and improve water quality. In addition, the fees collected enable municipalities to take on stormwater projects that will improve their ability to anticipate, prepare for, and respond to hazardous events related to climate, otherwise known as climate resiliency.
Cheltenham is highly susceptible to flood events and is working with agencies such as the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) on several flood mitigation projects. Even with significant funding contributed by the USACE and DEP, the Township will contribute substantial capital and operating dollars to these and other flood mitigation projects. 
Managing the Township’s municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) – the system of pipes, drains, ditches, and other conveyances that carry stormwater into the waters of the U.S. – also carries significant costs to maintain and meet the requirements of the Clean Water Act, a necessity for federal permission to release stormwater into federal waters. The Township’s stormwater capital and operating costs will only increase as regulations become more stringent.
Resiliency, flood mitigation and water quality projects will continue to place a strain on the Township’s budgets and will likely require tax increases. The Township is investigating a stormwater impact fee as an equitable option for financing these costs. 
The stormwater impact fee will be assessed based on a property’s use of the Township’s stormwater system. Properties with more building, parking lot, and other impervious coverage will be charged more, as they typically generate more stormwater than smaller properties. Often, properties with significant amounts of impervious coverage, such as schools and religious institutions, are those that pay little to no property taxes. They would, however, be required to pay a stormwater impact fee. 
The selected consultant will also be working with the Township to identify opportunities to reduce the stormwater impact fee. Credits could be assessed to a property that implements Best Management Practices (BMPs) proven to reduce the amount and/or improve the quality of stormwater entering the MS4.
Cheltenham will be joining the growing number of communities in Pennsylvania investigating a stormwater impact fee. Approximately 40 communities across Pennsylvania have stormwater impact fees, including Philadelphia, Radnor Township, and West Chester Borough. Municipalities with stormwater impact fees also receive more grant or financing opportunities to further offset the costs of stormwater management projects.Stormwater Matters: Financing Our Future Public Meeting No. 1 Recap
Cheltenham held a virtual public meeting on January 27, 2021 to discuss investing in the improvement of the Township's stormwater management program so it can help improve the health and safety of the Township by reducing flooding, improving water quality and better managing stormwater drainage systems.
If you missed the meeting, you can catch up by watching the  video and/or reviewing the  PowerPoint presentation.  InformationApril 12, 2023 Public Works Committee Meeting - Review of Year 1 (2022) of Stormwater Fee Implementation ( PowerPoint) (Video)

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) released new Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) that went into effect on March 2, 2016. These are official maps of the community, on which the Administrator has delineated both the special hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to our community, including a graphical representation of Special Flood Hazard Areas, flood hazard risk zones, 0.2% chance floodplain areas, and other flood related information. No significant changes have been made to the flood hazard data on the preliminary and/or revised preliminary copies of the FIRM for Montgomery County. Anyone in Cheltenham Township with a mortgage from a federally-regulated lender, whose property in any way encroaches a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), is required to carry flood insurance. Flood insurance is available through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is a federally underwritten program, provided by insurance companies through licensed insurance agents.

As part of this process, in 2014, Cheltenham Township amended and adopted a Floodplain Conservation District Ordinance, accessible in the  Township municipal code, which incorporated certain minimum requirements that are essential in order for the community to participate in the NFIP. This Ordinance is part of Article XXI of Chapter 295 of the Zoning Ordinance, section 153 through 162.25. As part of the Letter of Final Map Determination, the Township made minor changes to its Ordinance, to be consistent with the FIRMs that went into effect on March 2, 2016.


To determine whether your property is in the Floodplain, please click on the link for the map services center at http://msc.fema.gov/portal and type in your property address. Use the view map option or the interactive map on the left of the location map to access your property. This page also provides the option to save this information for your records.


Please note that for properties near the Brookdale Levee, and as highlighted on panel 382 of 451 (0382G) of the FIRM, this area is still under study and as such, FEMA recommends that property owners continue to carry flood insurance, until such a time as the flood hazard information in this area is updated and a new FIRM for the area is released.
 

Any proposed improvements in the SFHA are required to submit a Base Flood Elevation (BFE) as part of their permit application, and will need to ensure that any and all improvements are above the BFE. At completion of the improvements, an inspection of the same is required, to ensure that work was done according to the BFE and building plans. For Commercial properties in the SFHA, a flood proofing certificate is required as part of the closeout of the permit.



Overview of Maps and Map Change Process for Properties

FEMA uses the most accurate flood hazard information available and applies rigorous standards in developing the FIRMs. However, because of limitations of scale or topographic definition of the source maps used to prepare FIRMs, sometimes a property’s existing structures lie out of the floodplain while portions of the property lie in the floodplain.  Recognizing that these situations do occur, FEMA has established an administrative process or procedure that enables a change in the designation of a property on the FIRM. Through these processes, an individual who owns, rents, or leases property may submit certain mapping and survey information to FEMA and request that FEMA issue a document known as a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), accessible at the following link http://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/31858, which is an official amendment to an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), typically issued to remove a property and/or structure from a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). In most cases, the applicant will need to hire a Licensed Land Surveyor or Registered Professional Engineer to prepare an Elevation Certificate for the property.
  
For properties or structures that have been elevated, a Letter of Map Revision (based on fill) LOMR-F, is used, and this verifies that an existing structure or parcel of land that was elevated by fill, would not be inundated by the 1% chance flood. The link for this form is also http://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/31858.  This too is submitted to FEMA in conjunction with an elevation certificate.

Upon receiving a complete application forms package, FEMA will normally complete its review and issue its determination in 4 to 6 weeks. The Elevation Certificate can also be procured from your insurance agent as it is generally required for all NFIP participants. This would only be applicable if your property has always been a part of the program.

FEMA has streamlined this process even further by designing a web-based tool specifically for licensed land surveyors and professional engineers (referred to as Licensed Professionals or LPs) and FEMA approved National Flood Determination Association (NFDA) Certified Professionals (CPs). This can be used for submitting selected Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) requests, known as an electronic Letter of Map Amendment (eLOMA), for which a determination is made automatically. To register to become an eLOMA licensed professional, please fill out the registration form at https://hazards.fema.gov.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) released new Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) that went into effect on March 2, 2016. These are official maps of the community, on which the Administrator has delineated both the special hazard areas and the risk premium zones applicable to our community, including a graphical representation of Special Flood Hazard Areas, flood hazard risk zones, 0.2% chance floodplain areas, and other flood related information. No significant changes have been made to the flood hazard data on the preliminary and/or revised preliminary copies of the FIRM for Montgomery County. Anyone in Cheltenham Township with a mortgage from a federally-regulated lender, whose property in any way encroaches a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), is required to carry flood insurance. Flood insurance is available through the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which is a federally underwritten program, provided by insurance companies through licensed insurance agents.

As part of this process, in 2014, Cheltenham Township amended and adopted a Floodplain Conservation District Ordinance, accessible in the  Township municipal code, which incorporated certain minimum requirements that are essential in order for the community to participate in the NFIP. This Ordinance is part of Article XXI of Chapter 295 of the Zoning Ordinance, section 153 through 162.25. As part of the Letter of Final Map Determination, the Township made minor changes to its Ordinance, to be consistent with the FIRMs that went into effect on March 2, 2016.


To determine whether your property is in the Floodplain, please click on the link for the map services center at http://msc.fema.gov/portal and type in your property address. Use the view map option or the interactive map on the left of the location map to access your property. This page also provides the option to save this information for your records.


Please note that for properties near the Brookdale Levee, and as highlighted on panel 382 of 451 (0382G) of the FIRM, this area is still under study and as such, FEMA recommends that property owners continue to carry flood insurance, until such a time as the flood hazard information in this area is updated and a new FIRM for the area is released.
 

Any proposed improvements in the SFHA are required to submit a Base Flood Elevation (BFE) as part of their permit application, and will need to ensure that any and all improvements are above the BFE. At completion of the improvements, an inspection of the same is required, to ensure that work was done according to the BFE and building plans. For Commercial properties in the SFHA, a flood proofing certificate is required as part of the closeout of the permit.



Overview of Maps and Map Change Process for Properties

FEMA uses the most accurate flood hazard information available and applies rigorous standards in developing the FIRMs. However, because of limitations of scale or topographic definition of the source maps used to prepare FIRMs, sometimes a property’s existing structures lie out of the floodplain while portions of the property lie in the floodplain.  Recognizing that these situations do occur, FEMA has established an administrative process or procedure that enables a change in the designation of a property on the FIRM. Through these processes, an individual who owns, rents, or leases property may submit certain mapping and survey information to FEMA and request that FEMA issue a document known as a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), accessible at the following link http://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/31858, which is an official amendment to an effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), typically issued to remove a property and/or structure from a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA). In most cases, the applicant will need to hire a Licensed Land Surveyor or Registered Professional Engineer to prepare an Elevation Certificate for the property.
  
For properties or structures that have been elevated, a Letter of Map Revision (based on fill) LOMR-F, is used, and this verifies that an existing structure or parcel of land that was elevated by fill, would not be inundated by the 1% chance flood. The link for this form is also http://www.fema.gov/media-library/assets/documents/31858.  This too is submitted to FEMA in conjunction with an elevation certificate.

Upon receiving a complete application forms package, FEMA will normally complete its review and issue its determination in 4 to 6 weeks. The Elevation Certificate can also be procured from your insurance agent as it is generally required for all NFIP participants. This would only be applicable if your property has always been a part of the program.

FEMA has streamlined this process even further by designing a web-based tool specifically for licensed land surveyors and professional engineers (referred to as Licensed Professionals or LPs) and FEMA approved National Flood Determination Association (NFDA) Certified Professionals (CPs). This can be used for submitting selected Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) requests, known as an electronic Letter of Map Amendment (eLOMA), for which a determination is made automatically. To register to become an eLOMA licensed professional, please fill out the registration form at https://hazards.fema.gov.

Public Meetings
In order to maintain social distancing practices, the Township will hold public meetings via web or tele-conference. Log-in information will be made available on each meeting agenda. Meetings of the Board of Commissioners and its standing committees will continue to be recorded and the recordings will be made available on the Township's YouTube channel and shared to the website.

 Ordinance No. 2403-20 Emergency Ordinance
The regular legislative meetings of the Board of Commissioners, generally held on the third Wednesday of each month, are being held in a hybrid format.  Staff will be available at Curtis Hall for any member of the public wishing to attend in person, while the meeting will also be conducted via Zoom for the benefit of both the Board and public.
Administration Department
The Township Manager, as the Chief Executive and Administrative Officer of the Township, directs and administers all executive and non-legislative activities of the Township, except as otherwise provided by statute or Ordinance. The organizational structure includes the selection of key Department Heads and other management positions and professional consultants for ensuring the goals and objectives of the Board of Commissioners and Administration are met.

Get Approval for Construction in the Floodplain
Construction projects in the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) have special requirements.  To determine if your project is in the floodplain,  use the floodplain map.
You must submit the  Substantial Improvement/Substantial Damage worksheet with all zoning or building permit applications for construction in the SFHA.
More information on Substantial Improvement (SI) or Substantial Damage (SD) can be found in  this SI/SD Fact Sheet. 
WHO:
Any property owner or their authorized agent may request approval.  Authorized agents include:

Design professionals
Attorneys
Contractors
Licensed expediters

HOW:
Determine whether your project is in a floodplain.  To find out, enter the property's address into the  floodplain map.
If your project is in the floodplain, submit the  SI/SD Worksheet with your Building Permit Application.  Office hours: 8am to 4pm, Monday-Friday.
 
Requesting FEMA map revisions
In order for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise a flood hazard map, the Township must sign a Community Acknowledgment Form.  To request the Township's signature, 

Complete the  FEMA's Community Acknowledgment Form.
Submit the Community Acknowledgment Form to the Township for processing and signature.

Public Meetings
In order to maintain social distancing practices, the Township will hold public meetings via web or tele-conference. Log-in information will be made available on each meeting agenda. Meetings of the Board of Commissioners and its standing committees will continue to be recorded and the recordings will be made available on the Township's YouTube channel and shared to the website.

 Ordinance No. 2403-20 Emergency Ordinance
The regular legislative meetings of the Board of Commissioners, generally held on the third Wednesday of each month, are being held in a hybrid format.  Staff will be available at Curtis Hall for any member of the public wishing to attend in person, while the meeting will also be conducted via Zoom for the benefit of both the Board and public.
Administration Department
The Township Manager, as the Chief Executive and Administrative Officer of the Township, directs and administers all executive and non-legislative activities of the Township, except as otherwise provided by statute or Ordinance. The organizational structure includes the selection of key Department Heads and other management positions and professional consultants for ensuring the goals and objectives of the Board of Commissioners and Administration are met.
