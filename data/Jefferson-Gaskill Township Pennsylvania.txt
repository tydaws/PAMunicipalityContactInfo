Gaskill Township, Jefferson County Pennsylvania History





History


Gaskill was the fourteenth township, and was organized in 1842. It was
  formed from a portion of Young, and was named for Hon. Charles C. Gaskill,
  agent of the Holland Land Company. The township is bounded on the north by
  Henderson, on the east by Clearfield county, on the south by Indiana county,
  and on the west by Bell township.
This township occupies the southeastern corner of Jefferson county. A
  considerable part of the township is uncultivated woodland; other parts of the
  region, as for example the ravines of Ugly Run and Clover Run, are rugged from
  the outcrop of the Mahoning sandstone. The surface generally is high. Chestnut
  Ridge in the southeast corner has elevations of nearly two thousand feet above
  tide-water, along it summit and western flank. This ridge is the dividing one
  between the waters of the Susquehanna and the Ohio.
Early Settlements -- The family of Carpenter Winslow, who came from Maine,
  in 1818, were the first to settle in what is now Gaskill township. They
  cleared the land and made the first improvements.
