Tax Information 



 Real Estate TaxThe 2022 real estate tax is .60 mills for Codorus Township, 6.9 mills for York County, and 19.91 mills for Southern York County School District. Visit the York County Assessment Office website to look up your assessment, view tax maps, and check for rate updates. It also has the information and application for Clean & Green.Important to know:Property assessment values are determined by the York County Assessment Office — not by the Township or School District.The assessed value is not necessarily the fair market value or the purchase price.Real estate bills for the County and Township are mailed to property owners on February 15th.School taxes are mailed to property owners on July 1st.Delinquent real estate taxes (taxes unpaid after December 31st) are turned over to the York County Tax Claim Bureau for collection.Acceptance of a check from a taxpayer is at most a conditional payment of taxes; the taxes are not considered fully paid until the check has cleared the bank.Failure to receive a tax notice shall not relieve any taxpayer from the payment of any taxes imposed by any taxing district and such taxpayer shall be charged with his taxes as though he received notice.

Earned Income TaxResidents of Codorus Township are required to pay 1.3% of their earned income tax (salaries, wages, business profits, etc.) to the York Adams Tax Bureau. The Bureau, in turn, distributes 0.5% to the Township and 0.8% is forwarded to the school district.Important to know:Pennsylvania employers will deduct the income tax from your pay. If you are self-employed, you must pay the required amount to the Bureau by April 15 (for the preceding calendar year).Self-employed persons or employees whose employers are not withholding the correct amount are required to make quarterly payments to the Bureau.
