Welcome To Whitehall Township


Whitehall Township is located in the center of the Lehigh Valley. The Township is one hour north of Philadelphia and an hour and half from New York City.   Settled in the early 1700's by Pennsylvania Germans "Dutch", it was founded and named by the British in 1752, incorporated in 1867, named a First Class Township in 1902 and a Home Rule Community in 1976.   Today, Whitehall is home to 27,500 residents who reside in eight village neighborhoods who value our quality of life, municipal services, trail networks, parks, pools, events and outdoor recreational opportunities.   The community is home to 22 houses of worship.

Whitehall's MacArthur Road is known as the main shopping district in the Lehigh Valley.  MacArthur Road will celebrated its 75th Anniversary of being named in honor of General Douglas MacArthur, a World War II hero in 2017.   Whitehall is home to the largest indoor shopping center and Lifestyle Center at the Lehigh Valley Mall and four major shopping centers located along the "Golden Strip" (MacArthur Road).

The Whitehall-Coplay School District is located on one central campus, with one high school, one middle school, one intermediate school, two elementary schools, two stadiums and our Community Library.   The School District is known for its support of academics, the arts and athletics.

We invite you to visit Whitehall and see why so many call this place home.
