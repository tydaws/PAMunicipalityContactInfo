PLASTIC BAG ORDINANCE
 
Beginning March 19, 2023, Tredyffrin Township retail & restaurant establishments are prohibited by HR-454 from providing single-use plastic carry out bags and non-recyclable paper bags to their customers. Reusable and recyclable paper bags may be provided at point of sale for no less than $0.15 per bag. The Tredyffrin Township Board of Supervisors adopted this ordinance by Public Hearing at their September 19, 2022 regularly scheduled meeting.
Also prohibited by HR-454 is the use of polystyrene food containers and single use plastic straws. Click here for view HR-454...
The use of single plastic bags has severe environmental impacts, including entering local waterways, littering the environment and causing harm to wildlife, becoming stuck in or upon natural resources and public property, and blocking storm drains. Shopping with reusable, compostable or recyclable paper bags can help reduce waste and litter and keep our Township streets and waterways clean.
