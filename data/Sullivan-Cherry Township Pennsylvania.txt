Welcome to Cherry Township, Butler County, PA

  Welcome To Cherry Township's Website

As part of improving our communications (especially during a pandemic), Cherry Township has launched a website.  There's information about the township and its departments, how-to (with downloadable forms) for building and septic permits, and a downloadable list of our ordinances and resolutions.
The agendas, meeting materials, and minutes for all public meetings moving forward will also be published to the website.
