Gun Permit Information











Pennsylvania law requires the Sheriff of Indiana County to process all applications by county residents for a license to carry firearms.
New applicants must include name, address and phone number of two (2) references that are not family members. We request the references be Indiana County residents. If they are not available, please use persons with reputable character that are familiar with you and are able to answer questions about your personality and background.
Licenses are issued to all those who qualify, based on a background investigation done by the Sheriffs Office through the Pennsylvania State Police Instant Check System (PICS). Once an application for license to carry is filed, the Sheriff has 45 days in which to do the investigation and notify the applicant. The license is valid for 5 years. The Sheriff has the ability to revoke the license at any time for misuse.
All applicants are required to have a valid Pennsylvania Driver's License or Pennsylvania Photo Identification Card with a current address and must pay a fee of $20.00 (Personal Check, Money Order and/or Cash) is accepted at the time the application is submitted.
The Sheriff also licenses all firearms dealers in Indiana County. For more information on firearms licensing and safety please call our office at 724.465.3930

Click on the link below.
Print the application.
Fill out the form completely.
Call 724.465.3930 to schedule an appointment. Appointments will be made between 9:00am - 2:00pm Monday thru Friday.  We are not able to accept walk-ins. 
Sign the form then bring it into the sheriff's office with your payment.

NOTE: The person requesting the permit MUST bring the application in person.









Gun Permit Application










Opening the application requires Adobe Acrobat Reader.
Gun Laws vary by state. Go to the National Rifle Association to check the gun laws where you live.
 
When / If an applicant is denied, they have a right to challenge by submitting a PICS Challenge Form SP4-197.
State law now provides that the Challenge form must be submitted to the PICS Challenge Unit within 30 days of the date the individual is denied. No personal information will be discussed by phone.
Challenges are not accepted from applicants who cancel their background check prior to completion of the transaction by Pennsylvania Instant Check System (PICS). Only those individuals who have been denied or undetermined by a representative of PICS may submit a challenge form.

Where We Live
A Comprehensive Plan for Indiana County, Pennsylvania is the name of the new Comprehensive Plan that will replace the outdated Indiana County Comprehensive Plan from the 1960s. Unlike an ordinance, Where We Live has no regulatory authority.  It will, however, be an official policy document for the County.
Where We Live will identify strategies for maintaining and enhancing our unique sense of place and our quality of life by establishing policies and land use guidelines to help local governments ensure the orderly development of land, encouraging development that balances growth with Indiana County’s rural character; and encouraging development that connects people with each other, with communities and with the countryside.  Where We Live will establish a framework for future growth, conservation, and preservation that strengthens our existing communities and responsibly stewards our natural, agricultural and cultural resources.
What is a Comprehensive Plan?
A county comprehensive plan is a document that identifies community development objectives and policies to guide future growth and development patterns. It can assist local leaders in decision-making by creating a blueprint for land use patterns of tomorrow and charting the County’s path into the future.
Where We Live is being developed in accordance with the requirements of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (MPC), which states that all comprehensive plans must include the following components:
Statement of community development objectives;

Plan for land use
Plan to meet housing needs
Plan for movement of people and goods
Plan for community facilities and utilities
Plan for the protection of natural and historic resources
Plan for the reliable supply of water
Statement of interrelationships among various plan elements
Short- and long-range implementation strategies
Statement that existing and proposed development is consistent with or can be buffered against that in contiguous municipalities

The MPC also requires county comprehensive plans to identify:

Land uses as they relate to important natural resources and utilization of existing minerals
Current and proposed land uses which have regional impact and significance
A plan for preservation of prime agricultural land that encourages compatibility of land use regulations with agricultural operations
A plan for historic preservation

Adopted comprehensive plans provide a context for important future decisions.  Among the kinds of decisions that a comprehensive plan helps to guide are:

Requests to implement or modify zoning
Decisions about expansion of infrastructure
Decisions about location of new infrastructure
Decisions about major public investments
