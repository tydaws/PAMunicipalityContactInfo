Rates, Billing Information & Payment Options

















 



 
Basic service rates

White Township bills property owners quarterly for the following essential services

● Sanitary sewage service by White Township Municipal Authority           $60 per quarter

● Recycling collection                                                                                         $6 per quarter

● Stormwater management                                                                               $6 per quarter

These services are assessed to each residential unit (single family home or each apartment in a multifamily house). Owners are billed at the end of each quarter of service. Bills generally are mailed at the beginning of January, April, July and October. Payments generally are due January 31, April 30, July 31 and October 31 (unless on a weekend or holiday, then the next business day). Payments received after the due date are assessed a 6 percent late fee (on sewage and stormwater billing).

Commercial rates differ and are listed on the township fee schedule.

On behalf of water and electric utilities, White Township annually bills property owners for fire hydrants (properties within a 780-foot radius) and street lights (those within a 250-foot radius). Owners/residents may contact the township office for specific calculations.

Customers may pay online or by credit/debit card at the township office beginning with the second-quarter (April 3) bills for sewage, recycling and stormwater management. Payments of fees for permits and other township services also will be accepted by credit/debit card beginning April 3 at the township office.
Payments also are accepted by cash, check or money order by postal mail or at the counter or the drop box at the White Township office, 950 Indian Springs Road, Indiana, PA 15701. Some customers’ banks may allow users to pay online through the bank websites.

Other fees for White Township services (such as site plan review, open records requests, road bonds and others) are periodically established by resolution of the board of supervisors. Click here to view or download the most recent rate schedule resolution (Jan. 8, 2020).
